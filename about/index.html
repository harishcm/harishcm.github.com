<h2 id="about_this_website"><a name="index1h2"></a>About this Website</h2>

<p>This website is an integral part of my 
<a href="../records/2006/unschooling_project/">Unschooling Project</a>, 
which grew from my initial forays into self-directed learning.</p>

<p>It seeks to provide an introduction to self-directed learning,
especially for students who are currently schooling in a 
mainstream education system, and for parents and teachers of such students.
It also acts as a showcase of my self-directed learning
journeys, experiences, methods and creations.</p>

<h2 id="about_me"><a name="index2h2"></a>About Me</h2>

<p>Name: Mohanadas <em>Harish</em> Chandar <br />
Location: Singapore  </p>



<p>My passion for self-directed learning got crystallised around the year 2006. 
It was my first year at university, and it occurred to me that if 
I did not change myself, I was headed straight for the rat race.
School, even with its fond memories, had not prepared me for much else.
My university course was not going to either.</p>

<p>I was lucky. Just before entering university, I had gotten acquainted with 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unschooling">unschooling</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autodidactism">autodidactism</a>.
Both provided an authoritative voice that learning was a natural process.
The unschooling community went further. 
It provided specific guidance regarding issues that students in mainstream
schooling face, and what to do about it.
I realised that one could apply the principles of unschooling
while not leaving school as yet.</p>

<p>Feeling enlightened, I started keeping records of my learning pursuits
and started taking my self-directed learning seriously.</p>
