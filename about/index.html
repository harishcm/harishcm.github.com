<h2 id="about_this_website">About this Website</h2>

<p>This website is an integral part of my 
<a href="../records/2006/unschooling_project/">Unschooling Project</a>, 
which grew from my initial forays into self-directed learning.</p>

<p>It seeks to act as a showcase of my self-directed learning
journeys, experiences, methods, records and so on.
It also seeks to provide a grounded introduction to self-directed learning,
especially for students who are currently schooling in a 
mainstream education system, and for parents and teachers of such students.</p>

<p>My interest in self-directed learning began around year 2006. 
It was my first year at university, and it occurred to me that if 
I did not change myself, I was headed straight for the rat race.
School, even with its fond memories, had not prepared me for much else.
My university course was not going to either.</p>

<p>I was lucky. Just before entering university, I had gotten acquainted with 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unschooling">unschooling</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autodidactism">autodidactism</a>.
Both provided an authoritative voice that learning was a natural process.
The unschooling community went further. 
It even provided specific guidance regarding issues that students in mainstream
schooling face.
Much of it had to do with how one could apply the principles of unschooling
while not leaving school as of yet.</p>

<p>Feeling enlightened, I started keeping records of my learning pursuits
and started taking my self-directed learning seriously.</p>
