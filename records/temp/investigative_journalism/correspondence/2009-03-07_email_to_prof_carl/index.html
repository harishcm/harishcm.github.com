<pre>Subject: Your views on making social science journal articles more accessible to `laymen'?

Dear Prof Carl,

I am Harish, currently in your GE3210 class. I am majoring in civil engineering in NUS and currently in my second year.

Reading the recommended journal articles from the past few weeks of this module made me realise that there is a huge amount of great `investigative journalism' contained within them.

I feel that these articles would benefit more people if they (or their findings and concepts) were to reach a larger audience, in a more direct manner. Easy examples would be engineering students in NUS and engineering consultants working on `development' projects. But I feel that range can be very much larger, and applicable to people from many different walks of life. I am greatly interested in bringing out issues discussed in social science academic journals to a much larger audience in accessible ways.

As such I would like to ask you, generally, how do you search for or come across articles in a specific field that interests you? Especially so if the field is not something you are familiar with.

Also, what accessible pathways would you suggest for people with little social science backgrounds to get familiar with the `theoretical concepts' behind the articles that they would come across? For instance I myself am in the category of people with little social science backgrounds.

I look forward to your views on the above questions! It would also be greatly appreciated if you could link me to written articles, reports, etc.

Many thanks,
Harish
