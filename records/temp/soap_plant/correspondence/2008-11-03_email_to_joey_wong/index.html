<pre>Subject: Progress in research and examples of ``soap plants''

Dear Joey,

This is Harish. How have you been? Let me update you on the
progress made in research about ``soap plants'' and give a few examples. 

So far, I have found a database containing several plants that can be 
used directly as soap substitues. This [search result][sr] gives you
all the plants in the database that can be used directly as soap substitues.

[sr]: http://www.pfaf.org/database/search_use.php?K[]=Soap

There are some plants that are more popular, at least on the internet. 
I have listed a few of them as a postscript (below). Most of the 
references have been the above database, wikipedia and other websites, 
and a bit of background reading on soap-making and saponins.

It seems that there are many plants around the world that can and have been
used as ``soap plants'' for centuries. It also seems like different plants
have come to be used in niche areas, such as detergents for delicate fabrics,
shampoo, etc. 

What do you think about the progress so far? I was thinking that it would be
good to actually get a sample of one of these ``soap plants'' just to see
for ourselves how they work. What you you think? 
Also, I am tempted to come out with a report type of document in time.
But do you think that is beneficial? What is a better way of 
presenting the information?

I am also kind of unsure of how we intend to proceed from here. 
I feel that there are many other issues to take note of,
beyond the fact that the plants are ``soap plants''.
For example, saponins can be poisonous to fish and snails. 
Thus, runoff may have to be controlled. Also, the possibility of 
the ``soap plants'' becoming invasive species, the availability of 
space for growing the plants, etc.

Should we meet up for a discussion on how to proceed further? I will probably
look into the other plants in the database by them. Maybe you could
also introduce related plans that you and WTO have.

Best regards,
Harish

P.S.

Soapnut/Soapberry---Sapindus
----------------------------
Is a genus of shrubs and trees. The fruits and nuts can be used as 
soap by rubbing them in water. It is commonly used as a 
natural detergent to wash clothes. 

Seems to be widely exported from India to Europe and the US.

A problem might be that the trees may take several years to bear fruit.
However, the trees may be fairly drought resistant after fully grown.
I have to check further on this though.

Soapworts---Saponaria
---------------------
Is a genus of perennial herbs. The whole plant, especially the 
roots can be crushed or boiled in water to obtain the soap. It is 
commonly used as a gentle detergent for delicate fabrics and 
recommended for use as a shampoo.

It is native to Europe, US, China and Southwest Asia.

A problem is the required preparation before it can be used as soap.
Fuel also may have to be found for boiling.

Bracken---Pteridium
-------------------
Is a genus of large ferns. The rhizome (underground stem) easily forms a
foam in water and can be used as soap.

It grows all around the world, except in hot and cold deserts.

A big problem can be that Bracken can easily become an 
invasive species due to its fast growth rate. There are also concerns about
spores causing stomach cancers.

Others
------
There are many other plants that can possibly be used directly as soap
substitutes. Other popular ones include Soaptree---Yucca and 
Soapbark---Quillaija.
