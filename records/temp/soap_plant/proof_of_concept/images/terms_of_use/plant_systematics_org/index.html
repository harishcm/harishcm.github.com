TERMS OF USE: IMAGES AND OTHER ORIGINAL INFORMATION

The content on this website, including links to other websites, is provided as is and is not guaranteed to be accurate.

Images on this site may be downloaded for PRIVATE EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY (e.g., for lectures or presentations). No image may be reproduced on another website or in any publication, electronic or paper, without permission of the owner. Please clearly identify this website if you make any links from other websites.

If you wish to use an image for any purpose other than a course lecture or noncommercial presentation, you MUST obtain permission from the owner of the image. You may be able to obtain a higher resolution version of the image as well. If an email address for the owner is not posted, contact kcn2@cornell.edu.

Plantsystematics.org is a collaborative project. It is not funded by NSF. The entire project is run from a single desktop computer at Cornell University. All software, including database interfaces and web interfaces, has been developed by Kevin Nixon who retains copyrights. Images, keys and other content are mostly contributed by the curators (see below) and by students, faculty and colleagues at Cornell University and the New York Botanical Garden. EACH CONTRIBUTOR RETAINS COPYRIGHTS ON THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS. If you wish to become a contributor, please contact kcn2@cornell.edu.

The goal of PlantSystematics.org is to provide a complete source of systematic information on plants, with a particular focus at this point on vascular plants. Types of information available at this site include images, keys, cladograms, and links to nomenclatural information. A full classification database is being added, that will include alternative classification schemes such as the highly promoted "APG" classification for angiosperms.

The default classification currently implemented on the PlantSystematics.org website is a classification of genera of vascular plants that was developed at the New York Botanical Garden, mostly through the efforts of Daniel Atha. This classification is based on several works, including Takhtajan, Kubitski, and others. If you find omissions or errors in generic names, please notify kcn2@cornell.edu.
