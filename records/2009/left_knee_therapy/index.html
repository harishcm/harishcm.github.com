<div class="MainPage">
<ol>
<li class="L1">Inspiration <ol>
<p class="P2">I sometimes have an prolonged disomfort in my left knee while walking or
running. At times, it develops into a slight pain. It seems to be
especially noticeable when I am walking/running on hard surfaces such as
roads and pavements (which cover most of Singapore).
</p>
<p class="P2">
I have had this on and off for maybe 8 years now, interspaced by periods
with no noticeable discomfort. I feel that it may be a developmental
flaw that may be corrected with good physiotherapy.
</p>
<p class="P2">
Last year, I sought medical advice but ended up greatly dissatisfied
with the handling of my case. First the GP did not refer me to a
physiotherapist but instead to a bone doctor. Then, the bone doctors
seemed to simply want to quickly glance over my case.
</p>
<p class="P2">
The first one who requested me to take a x-ray of the knee cap only saw
the image that gave a front view (anterior posterior), and said that my
bones had no fracture cracks and that rest would solve it. Yes, I knew
that as well, but I also knew that it was a temporary solution. I was
angry that the didn&#8217;t even see the side view (lateral) images.
</p>
<p class="P2">
At the second appointment, I had to point out to another bone doctor
that the left knee cap seemed to be differently placed from the right
knee cap. Again I was told that rest would probably solve my discomfort.
When I pressed for an explanation he said that I may want to consider
going for an MRI if I felt too troubled by the discomfort.
</p>
<p class="P2">
At that point I did not want to continue with such medical advise any
longer as I felt that the service rendered did not even substantiate the
subsidised amount that I was paying. And my god, the government was
paying the remainder, which was huge!
</p>
<p class="P2">
I realised that I did not yet know enough to be able to make the medical
fraternity work for me in helping me fix my problem. So I decided to
first go and find out more about possible causes, explanations, and
therapy, and experiement with them on my own. </p>
</ol>
<li class="L1">Knee joint <ol>
<p class="P2">Highly complex
</p>
<li class="L2">Bone
<li class="L2">Articular capsule <ol>
<li class="L3">Synovial membrane
<li class="L3">Fibrous membrane
<li class="L3">Fatty deposits </ol>
<li class="L2">Bursae
<li class="L2">Menisci
<li class="L2">Ligaments </ol>
<li class="L1">Hyphotheses <ol>
<li class="L2">Soccer <ol>
<li class="L3">Extensive kicking only with right leg when young <ol>
<li class="L4">Left knee may have undergone extensive rotational forces </ol>
<li class="L3">Findings so far <ol>
<li class="L4">Right leg <ol>
<li class="L5">Has more skilled muscular movements of the foot
<li class="L5">Some muscles seem to be more developed </ol>
</ol>
<li class="L3">Possible therapy <ol>
<li class="L4">Gradually train the left leg <ol>
<li class="L5">Muscles required for kicking
<li class="L5">Skills training to train smaller muscles as well </ol>
</ol>
</ol>
<li class="L2">Drills <ol>
<li class="L3">Much greater stomping of left foot during drills <ol>
<p class="P4">I was in National Cadet Corps as a teenager and was extensively
involved in drills. The stationary drills involved stomping of
the left foot while tightening the muscles of the right leg for
balance a lot more than the reverse. </p>
</ol>
<li class="L3">Possible links to discomfort <ol>
<li class="L4">May have injured some part of the left knee
<li class="L4">May have developed an overuse of right leg <ol>
<li class="L5">To support body weight
<li class="L5">To provide balance </ol>
</ol>
<li class="L3">Possible therapy <ol>
<p class="P4">Reverse the stomping action may help to train the muscles of the
left leg to in providing better support to the knee joint. </p>
</ol>
</ol>
<li class="L2">Greater degree of flat footedness of left foot <ol>
<p class="P3">I performed a wet test and compared it to descriptions and with the
results of my mother&#8217;s feet which are medium arched. I have a low
arch on both feet but clearly, my left foot has a much lower arch.
Almost the whole of the left foot appears in the wet test.
</p>
<li class="L3">Possible causes <ol>
<li class="L4">Not going bare foot enough
<li class="L4">Constantly walking on very flat surfaces
<li class="L4">Genetic <ol>
<li class="L5">Have to check my father&#8217;s as well first </ol>
</ol>
<li class="L3">Possible therapy <ol>
<li class="L4">Barefoot runs/walks <ol>
<li class="L5">Along beach
<li class="L5">Along trails
<li class="L5">On grass </ol>
</ol>
</ol>
<li class="L2">Imbalance in strength of large muscles in left leg <ol>
<p class="P3">My left hamstring seems to be weaker than my right hamstring while
both my quadraceps seem to be have about the same strength. </p>
</ol>
<li class="L2">Weak anterior crucialte ligament (ACL) <ol>
<p class="P3">The ACL stabilises the knee against hyper-extension and excessive
rotation. I may have had an ACL injury that was not treated properly
when I was young. I have memories of having fallen on my knees in
the sand, resulting in a large wound in my left knee. It may have
resulted in an ACL injury that was left untreated. </p>
</ol>
</ol>
<li class="L1">Related issues <ol>
<li class="L2">Clicking sound in left knee cap <ol>
<p class="P3">I often get a clicking sound in my left knee cap when I bend my
knees while they are loaded. For instance the clicking happens while
getting into a squat from the standing position, but there is no
clicking when simply bending at my knees while sitting down. </p>
</ol>
<li class="L2">Sitting cross legged <ol>
<li class="L3">Pain and clicking sound in left knee <ol>
<li class="L4">Only when sitting with left leg on the inside </ol>
</ol>
<li class="L2">Right knee feels stronger and more in control <ol>
<li class="L3">Right knee has greater vibrational stability
<li class="L3">Right knee feels stronger
<li class="L3">Right knee seems to undergo far less rotation in daily activities <ol>
<p class="P4">Left knee seems to be subject to more rotational movements in my
usual patten of daily motions. </p>
</ol>
</ol>
<li class="L2">Ineffectiveness of conscious control of left leg motion <ol>
<li class="L3">Reasons <ol>
<li class="L4">The bio mechanics of leg motion are very complex
<li class="L4">Cannot control everything completely
<li class="L4">Possibly some of my muscles are weak </ol>
<li class="L3">Possible alternative <ol>
<li class="L4">Consciously focus only on where I want to go
<li class="L4">Let the legs and the sub-consciousness handle the leg motion
<li class="L4">Focus on strengthening the muscles instead </ol>

<li class="L2">Runner&#8217;s Knee <ol>
<li class="L3">How is it caused? <ol>
<p class="P4">Softening and wearing away of cartilage under the kneecap,
resulting in pain and inflamation? </p>
</ol>
<li class="L3">Therapy <ol>
<li class="L4">Single leg squats <ol>
<p class="P5">May help to place one leg, bent right angle, on a stool.
Gives more stability, allowing better focus on leg doing the
squat.
