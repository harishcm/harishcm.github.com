<li class="L2">Question <ol>
<li class="L3">How long can spiders shoot a line of their webs? <ol>
<li class="L4">Inspiration <ol>
<p class="P5">Sadu, Kin Fei, Wei Xiong and I were observing a tiny spider
at a coffee shop in Tampines after a failed attempt at
star gazing with Wei Xiong&#8217;s telescope.
</p>
<p class="P5">
We first observed the spider moving its jaws and front legs
in a repeated motion. Then we realised that it was actually
shooting a line of its web over a considerable distance as I
felt it land on one side of my forehead.
</p>
<p class="P5">
We were then shocked that it shot a line of its web over a
distance of more than one metre. That interested us in
playing around with cutting the last line it shot and
observing it shoot another.
</p>
<p class="P5">
After some time, the spider did its repeated jaw and leg
movement again. Only this time we couldn&#8217;t locate the web
line that it shot. Then suddenly it appeared as though it
was flying. We realised that it had shot a line from our
table all the way to the roof than was over 5m away. That
left us in complete shock, awe, admiration and me with a
burning question in mind. </p>

<li class="L3">Malaysia fly-ash contract <ol>
<p class="P4">One of my Profs was mentioning that several years ago in
Malaysia, there was a 10 year contract signed, supposedly with
the government, for a company to handle disposal of fly ash. The
company then used it in cement/concrete making and gained a huge
profit from them. An excellent example of converting a &#8220;waste
product&#8221; into something useful and making a huge profit along
the way.
