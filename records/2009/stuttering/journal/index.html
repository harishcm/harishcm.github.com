<li class="L4">The key to natural singing and speaking
<li class="L4">BY Theodore Dimon
<li class="L4">Book, 2011
<li class="L4">Initial Perception <ol>
<p class="P5">A book for the mass market created from a research thesis into
human voice production. I really like the point that an upright
posture (referred to as *support*) is the fundamental
prerequisite for effortless voice production, and that the
simple way to achieve the posture is to tilt the head lower
so that the spine, tendons and muscles are able to pull on
each other and achieve a stable tensile structure&#8212;similar
to how a tent works. </p>
</ol>
</ol>
</ol>
</ol>
<li class="L1">2012-08-05 <ol>
<li class="L2">Reflection <ol>
<p class="P3">I feel that it is time that I can put up some of my past stuttering
records on the internet. It feels weird though that I only dared to
do so after I had made significant strides in improving several
factors which influence and are influenced by this condition.
</p>
<p class="P3">
I still stutter, but my current workplace environment which allows
me to speak to different people (in different languages) has been a
huge enabler in addressing this condition.
</p>
<p class="P3">
I am also glad to have made a career change, the reasons behind
which, to a large extent, were to address my stuttering condition.
</p>
<p class="P3">
While there is still so much more that I can and wish to improve
on, I would be very happy if fellow people who stutter (and people
who empathise with stuttering or are interested in learning more
about it) find my records useful. </p>
</ol>
</ol>
<li class="L1">2012-07-26 <ol>
<li class="L2">Interview Experience <ol>
<p class="P3">This was a very good interview, which lasted for at least 45 minutes.
Stuttering was a relatively minor concern, and my preparations were
more focused on the angles in which I was going to present myself,
and in being more assertive yet friendly in my interactions. </p>
</ol>
</ol>
<li class="L1">2012-07-19 <ol>
<li class="L2">Interview Experience <ol>
<p class="P3">This was a interview in which I had a good approach towards
stuttering. Though I was having speech blocks, my nerves were calm
throughout the interview. </p>
</ol>
</ol>
<li class="L1">2012-02-07 <ol>
<li class="L2">Edited Outline <ol>
<li class="L3">How should I approach my stuttering? <ol>
<li class="L4">Ask &#8220;Why?&#8221;, not &#8220;How?&#8221; approach <ol>
<p class="P5">This approach looks into the motivations behind working to
address stuttering. It is a lot of hard work to address
stuttering, and it is a challenging endeavour, right from the
start. To a stutterer, addressing stuttering is an
ill-defined problem, rather than a clearly defined one. In other
words, addressing stuttering is not simply a problem of learning
or practising to &#8220;speak normally&#8221;. It cannot be approaching by
only asking &#8220;How?&#8221;. One needs to be asking &#8220;Why?&#8221; first.
</p>
<p class="P5">
There are at least two reasons for this. Firstly, what is
&#8220;normal&#8221; in speech is itself arbitrary.
everyone stutters occasionally and certain intense situations
can trigger stuttering even in a non-stutterer. Normal is
often a constant interplay between the judgement of others, and
standards that one sets for oneself. Unfortunately,
normal could be easily misconstructed by both stutterers
and non-stutterers as &#8220;perfection&#8221;. Perfection is too high a
standard and an unreasonable expectation for both stutterers and
non-stutterers.
</p>
<p class="P5">
The secondly, and perhaps more importantly, looking at
stuttering as a clearly defined problem lends itself to **covert
stuttering**, which is a personal choice, but can also be
viewed upon as a form of cover up, i.e. &#8220;if you can&#8217;t make it, fake it&#8221;.
To a non-stutterer, covert stuttering may be a problem solved,
but to a stutter, it demands continual sidestepping and
skirting, and imposes a huge emotional burden of dealing with
the uncertainty, lack of control and fear of being &#8220;discovered&#8221;.
It also makes the act of speaking in common everyday situations
an intensely emotional experience, each and every time. A
problem &#8220;solved&#8221; thus leads to other, possibly larger, problems.
</p>
<p class="P5">
Asking and answering &#8220;Why?&#8221; first, before asking
&#8220;How?&#8221;, can help with establishing useful and fitting goals
for the individual, based on the individual&#8217;s desires. Answers to
&#8220;Why?&#8221; can also provide a constant positive push to along the long
and challenging journey of addressing stuttering, and become in
themselves, part of the solution. </p>
</ol>
<li class="L4">Physical intelligence and voluntary stuttering approach <ol>
<p class="P5">This approach attempts to address stuttering, from a more
holistic point of view, looking at speech as a form of
&#8220;physical intelligence&#8221;, and using voluntary stuttering to
establish a norm during conversations. It has three parts:
</p>
<li class="L5">To have a sense of elegance and poise with regards to my posture <ol>
<p class="P6">But elegance and poise, I mean the kind that is natural and
makes one feel comfortable and at ease, not the pompous and
pretentious kind. A good posture improves speech, but more
holistically, a person with greater physical intelligence
should be able to stand, sit, move and speak with greater ease. </p>
</ol>
<li class="L5">To think of my body as a musical instrument, and feel the resonance in different parts of my body <ol>
<p class="P6">It is easiest to see the resonance in action when one is
humming or singing a tune. One can resonate or talk/sing
from different parts of the body, from the abdomen upwards,
to the chest, neck, face, nose, and even head (head&#8212;e.g.
Chinese Opera). For speech, it is usually most comfortable
to resonate in the abdomen, and the lower pitch sounds more
formal, for both men and women. </p>
</ol>
<li class="L5">To use voluntary stuttering in my interactions with people <ol>
<p class="P6">I am not going to be perfect, and aiming for perfection is
like chasing fools&#8217; gold. Voluntary stuttering makes the
stutterer in control of his/her voluntary stutters, and allows
the stutterer to control the non-verbal interactions during
these periods of stuttering. Through the voluntary stutters,
the stutter can establish a norm for the conversation. In
this way, tensions are eased for the stutter, and the other
party is aware of the stuttering from the beginning and can
respond and relate without confusion. </p>

<li class="L2">Interview Experience <ol>
<p class="P3">Was the best interview in a long time!
</p>
<li class="L3">Things I did right <ol>
<li class="L4">Went there half an hour early
<li class="L4">Did deep diaphragmatic breathing from half an hour before the interview
<li class="L4">Formed an initial heuristic about the interviewer
<li class="L4">Took my time to think of answers
<li class="L4">Trusted myself to come up with answers on the spot
<li class="L4">Continued deep, even somewhat loud, diaphragmatic throughout the interview
<li class="L4">Spoke slowly, clearly and directly about what I wanted and why I wanted it </ol>
<li class="L3">Comments <ol>
<li class="L4">I stuttered slightly at a couple of occasions, but it was OK
<li class="L4">I don&#8217;t need to be perfect, just OK is fine
<li class="L4">Gut feelings (i.e. heuristics) <ol>
<p class="P5">Trusting my gut feelings (i.e. heuristics) allows me to
decide upon an initial plan of action and behaviour.
Thereafter I can continue to analyse the situation, and
modify, or even completely change my subsequent plans of
action and behaviour. This allows me to be much more
confident during my interactions and speech. </p>

<li class="L1">2012-12 <ol>
<li class="L2">Feelings <ol>
<p class="P3">At my workplace right now (academic research at a government
university), people actually want to listen to what I have to say. I
don&#8217;t need to rush while speaking; people will take the time to
listen and to try to understand the messages that I am trying to
convey.
</p>
<p class="P3">
This might not be the case outside academia, or even outside a
university, or in social situations. Conversely though, if people
are not interested in what I have to say, one, it does speak about
them, and two, perhaps I should &#8220;move on&#8221; in my interactions
with them, either to the next topic, or to the next conversation
with another person.
</p>
<p class="P3">
I guess that a huge perk of adult life is that one gets to choose
from a large variety of choices. Perhaps, when one is stuck with
only a small number of choices (e.g. through hyper-specialisation,
because of emotional or financial commitments, or because of a
often misguided intention to recover sunk costs), one needs to
worry about one&#8217;s superiors, colleagues or other influential
people&#8217;s perception of one. </p>

<li class="L1">2011-11-30 <ol>
<li class="L2">Edited Outline <ol>
<li class="L3">How should I approach my stuttering? <ol>
<li class="L4">Speaking slowly and clearly approach <ol>
<p class="P5">I heard this on a drama series on television. The protagonist
was advising her friend who, at the last minute, wanted to
withdraw from a public debate because her nerves got the better
of her, that she had already practiced several times what she
wanted to say, and all she had to do was to speak slowly and
clearly. It stuck a chord with me, as unlike the approaches
above, it was non-judgemental, and plain and simple, yet
likely to be just as or more effective than the approaches above. </p>
</ol>
</ol>
</ol>
</ol>
<li class="L1">2011-09-21 <ol>
<li class="L2">Added Techniques <ol>
<li class="L3">Deep breathing and relaxing the spine and diaphragm <ol>
<p class="P4">Deep breathing exercises that I have found useful were those in
which I had let air fill and stretch both my lungs and all my
diaphragm all the way to their maximum capacity and then letting the
air out. It seems that there is a considerable feeling of relaxation
when deep breaths result in the portions of the diaphragm attached
to the spine being stretched and relaxed. </p>
</ol>
<li class="L3">Visualisation <ol>
<p class="P4">Visualisation is a form of mental rehearsal for subsequent
performances, including conversations, discussions and
presentations. It has been helpful in the past, especially in the
days leading up to a major event. Visualisations seem to also help
me set the overarching issues such as the tome and style of
delivery, the emotions that I would be feeling, the thoughts I would
be having, and the actions and body language that I would be using.
Visualisations need focus and concentration in clearing the mind of
confusion and occluded thoughts. </p>

<li class="L4">Perception 2011-09-21 <ol>
<p class="P5">By &#8220;Hollywood Standards&#8221;, the movie was not dramatic
enough, but I felt that it tried to portray a stutterer
accurately, while trying to keep the audience entertained at
the same time. To me, several scenes were nostalgic,
bringing back memories of the times that I too felt that I
had to perform something very well. I too had thought of
and put in place modifications, alterations and coping
strategies to overcome stuttering, and deliver a good
performance. I too have had in situations in which I had to
deliver a speech or a performance to an audience that shared
an emotional bond with me, and it had come out remarkably
well. As is usual in many movies, it was a happy ending.
The protagonist achieved self-actualisation of his purpose
in his speeches to the public at the time when Britain went
to war with Germany. On a personal note again, the movie
showed a model of overcoming stuttering that I had
subscribed to in the past, but one that I wish to move away
from. The above model may let one achieve remarkable feats,
but is less useful in the more mundane situations and
performances of day to day life, in which one only needs to
perform adequately, but consistently, and if less
preparation is required, the time freed up can be used for
other activities. </p>

<li class="L2">Edited Outline <ol>
<li class="L3">Added Techniques <ol>
<li class="L4">Looking into people&#8217;s face and eyes when speaking <ol>
<p class="P5">I notice that I developed a habit of looking downwards or closing my
eyes when stuttering while speaking to people.
</p>
<p class="P5">
At an interview, I realised that looking directly into the faces and
eyes of people I was talking to seemed to make the message get
across better. Also, it seemed to prevent individuals I talked
to from getting surprised or smirking while I was talking. Most
importantly, it made me feel better. All this, while I was
blocking, and saying &#8220;um&#8221; frequently, with long pauses between
words.
</p>
<p class="P5">
This is an interesting observation that I wish to explore further.
Perhaps, each individual I was talking to realised that he/she was
being looked at as well, and that he/she was being judged for
his/her behaviour and responses. When I closed my eyes however, they
may have not had this feeling, or may have felt that they could be
themselves as no one (including me) was looking at them.
</p>
<p class="P5">
There is probably quite a lot I can learn regarding this from
social-scientific concepts such as &#8220;the gaze&#8221;&#8212;the politics of
looking. Experimenting and learning more about eye contact would
definitely help. </p>

<li class="L4">Rights approach <ol>

<li class="L2">Ideas for Improvement <ol>
<li class="L3">Using self-speech and visualisation as a form of rehearsal for actual speech <ol>
<p class="P4">I used to do this during my secondary school days, but mainly
for the presentations and for other instances when I had to
perform in front of a group of people.
</p>
<p class="P4">
It would be interesting to self-speak and visualise about my day
to day conversations. It would also be a testbed for developing
my own methods, styles, tones and patterns of voice and speech. </p>
</ol>
<li class="L3">Removing emotions associated with speaking <ol>
<p class="P4">Coming from a perspective of looking at speech as a form of
learned and/or learn-able literacy, I am just coming out of
stage of poor speech literacy.
</p>
<p class="P4">
Poor literacy is commonly associated with strong emotions and
wild self-esteem fluctuations. These emotions and self-esteem
fluctuations are initially specific&#8212;to the task that one is
poorly literate at&#8212;but can spill over to other aspects of life
over time. A possible indicator for poor literacy is that one
cannot be objective about one&#8217;s performance at the task one
is poorly literate at.
</p>
<p class="P4">
Currently I have too many emotions associated with speaking.
Coming from a speech literacy perspective, it is a possible
indicator of poor speech literacy. It is a good step to remove
several of these emotions, so that I can move towards being more
objective about my speech skills. </p>
</ol>
<li class="L3">Putting myself into situations requiring frequent social interaction <ol>
<p class="P4">Again from a speech literacy point of view, repetition is
essential to improve one&#8217;s skills at a task. Frequent, &#8216;real&#8217;,
speaking situations are required for me to become more literate
at speaking.
</p>
<p class="P4">
This idea can be approached from an Operant Conditioning
perspective as well.
</p>
<p class="P4">
From an Operant Conditioning perspective, it happens that our
reaction to external stimuli is strongly influenced, not just by
the intensity of the stimuli, but also by the pattern of
intervals following which the stimuli is applied.
One of the methods of reducing a person&#8217;s reactions to external
stimuli is to apply the stimuli frequently, giving the person
little time to &#8216;recover&#8217; from his/her previous reaction. As time
goes by, the person&#8217;s reactions to that stimuli will drop
drastically. Conversely, there is likely to be an optimal
frequency at which a stimuli will produce the greatest amount of
response, summed up over time. If interval times are random, the
average and summed up response will be increased as well.
</p>
<p class="P4">
Frequent speaking interactions will thus reduce my discomfort
and emotional responses associated with speaking. Keeping
myself away from speaking will perpetuate my high levels of
discomfort and emotional responses associated with speaking.
From the Operant Conditioning perspective, the greatest
discomfort and emotional responses, averaged or summed over
time, would correspond to purposefully keeping my number of
speaking encounters low or moderate, and being forced into
difficult speaking situations occasionally. </p>
</ol>
</ol>
</ol>
<li class="L1">2011-02-21 <ol>
<li class="L2">Reflections <ol>
<li class="L3">Stuttering&#8212;when did/does it subside (correlations)? <ol>
<li class="L4">When I was providing and caring for myself multidimensionally? <ol>
<p class="P5">When I was in the USA for a work and travel programme, I was
working and living away from my family for 3 months.
During this period of time, I was hardly stuttering,
and I was providing for myself and cooking my own meals,
washing my own clothes, etc..
It is probable that being able to self-determine what I wish
to do, how I wish to take </p>
</ol>
<li class="L4">When I was in a society that valued individual viewpoints and individual rights? <ol>
<p class="P5">When I was in the USA for a work and travel programme, I was
free to say anything I wanted, and in any way that I wanted to.
Part of my stuttering definitely has to do with the
political climate in Singapore (my home country, a city-state).
People who speak up against the government in Singapore have
been jailed without trial, fined, or made bankrupt. </p>
</ol>
<li class="L4">When I am not anxious or fearful about possible outcomes <ol>
<p class="P5">Yes, when I am not anxious or fearful about possible
outcomes, I stutter a lot less.
Everyone stutters one in a while, and I think I stutter
slightly more than the general population.
But when I am not anxious or fearful, I can recover from
them easily. </p>
</ol>
<li class="L4">When I am able to speak with the emotions I want to portray <ol>
<p class="P5">I am fearful of portraying emotions, especially negative
ones, and those or unacceptance.
Part of it comes with me not wanting to hurt other people,
and trying to understand them.
But this really is empathy carried to the other extreme,
where I allow people to constantly put me down while being
nice to them.
Given the research that originated from Professor Axelrod&#8217;s
experiments into iterated prisonners dilemma, what I am
doing is hurting me.
</p>
<p class="P5">
Furthermore, it is as though my emotions come out
eventually, together with the fact that I want to suppress
them, and the fact that I am anxious, and have a lowered
self-esteem. </p>

parts of the body&#8212;the abdomen, the chest, the throat, the nose

<p class="P3">Over the past few weeks, I have been attempting to focus on
desensitization as the first step to being able to speak &#8220;normally&#8221;
again.
</p>
<p class="P3">
Desensitization does seem to work, and when I make it my
encouragements for desensitization overt, even stressful situations
or situations in which I already handled badly seem to end up fine.
</p>
<p class="P3">
One method of desensitization that seems to work really well is to
make a desensitization jingle, and repeat it over a few times.
</p>
<p class="P3">
It seems that making desensitization a habit would be an effective
first step to excellent speech. </p>

<li class="L3">Want <ol>
<li class="L4">What goes on in speakers&#8217; minds when they are speaking? <ol>
<li class="L5">Do they put themselves into an &#8220;elevated&#8221; state?
<li class="L5">Do they feel super-confident as if they can do anything?
<li class="L5">Do they feel as if it is day to day work? </ol>
</ol>
<li class="L3">My fears <ol>
<li class="L4">Being judged <ol>
<p class="P5">I used to not realise that I was afraid of being judged.
It was after hearing from other people that they dislike
(or are afraid of) being judged that I started to
realise that I am too, afraid of being judged.
In the society that I live in, being judged is something
that happens all the time, and is even welcomed as the
norm or the right thing to do in the job market. </p>
</ol>
<li class="L4">Being simply mediocre <ol>
<p class="P5">Oftentimes, I only want to be the best or one
of the best. Part of it comes from wanting to be a
goodie-goodie and a perfectionist in school. Part of it
comes from the constant pushing and high expectations of
my father when I was younger.
</p>
<p class="P5">
This extends into my speech. On one side, I want to
either make an unusually excellent impression every time
I open my mouth, or not simply not speak at all.
At the same time however, these days, I do realise that
failures, rejections and asking questions, even dumb
questions, are integral and oftentimes useful parts life.
It is only in school that we frown over such things.
</p>
<p class="P5">
The disorder comes from the clash of these two ideals.
My conversations and presentations end up with me
feeling either very good about them or very lousy about
them. </p>

<li class="L3">Possible philosophies <ol>
<li class="L4">Self-worth
<li class="L4">Speech literacy </ol>
<li class="L3">Current plans <ol>
<li class="L4">Practice letting go <ol>
<p class="P5">As a start to improvement, I want to practice letting
thing go. If some thing goes wrong, just let it go and
do not bother to analyze it too deeply. The next attempt
will be a fresh one. The failure does not reflect upon
me as a person, or change my self-worth.
Conversely, if something goes well, just let go as well.
The success does not reflect upon me as a person, or
change my self-worth either.
This is in preparation for being able to consciously and
objectively observe the way I am speaking and to seek
improvements from a speech literacy point of view. </p>

<p class="P6">Oftentimes there was a mismatch between the information
the speakers&#8217; were trying to convey and the delivery of
the speech. Trivial or not so important issues were
delivered in too dramatic a manner. </p>
</ol>
<li class="L5">The &#8220;Western&#8221; overtones during the session <ol>

address local slangs and customary ways of interaction
that is considered appropriate.
This can however be addressed with some deliberation. </p>

<p class="P3">
I was however slightly sleep deprived and pretty tired as well.
These may have contributed to making the situation better. </p>

<p class="P5">It seems like &#8220;big shots&#8221; spend a large portion of their
time investing in themselves&#8212;self-image, self-fitness,
behavioural reactions to others, personality, conversation
topics, body language, dressing, etc.
</p>
<p class="P5">
Also, they speak the languages that they know in a proper
and skillful manner. This could be a solution to my Singlish
dilemma. </p>

<li class="L1">2009-11-19 <ol>
<li class="L2">Did <ol>
<li class="L3">Edited Outline <ol>
<li class="L4">Factors improving my speech <ol>
<li class="L5">Consciously adopting a relaxed mindset </ol>
</ol>
</ol>
<li class="L2">Observation <ol>
<p class="P3">I consciously adopted a relaxed mindset for a while today. It lasted
about an hour. I slowed down my walking pace, and the first
conversation that I had with a guy went well.
</p>
<p class="P3">
Then, I had to meet more people including a lady, and that made me
lose a sizeable part of the relaxed mindset. I kept wondering how
much attention to give her, what I should talk to her about, and so
on.
</p>
<p class="P3">
Later, I met a Professor and other people in a small classroom
setting, and I lost the remaining part of my relaxed mindset, going
back to my &#8216;common&#8217; self. </p>
</ol>
<li class="L2">Thought <ol>
<li class="L3">Treating people differently <ol>
<p class="P4">I want to treat different people differently. I have done this
before, during my secondary school and JC days, but I changed
myself. It was because I had realised that arguably, I was not
being fair in several cases. Maybe back then I was a little
extreme.
</p>
<p class="P4">
Now, maybe I am on the other side of the spectrum, trying to
accept and please everyone that I see. This is stressful, though
currently &#8216;common&#8217; in my daily life, and is definitely
unhealthy. Both the people around me, and the way that I feel
about myself play a part in this.
</p>
<p class="P4">
I also seem to want to please the people whom actually don&#8217;t care
two hoots about me, while pretty much neglecting or even being
suspicious of the people who treat me well. This of course ties
in with wanting to pay attention to the &#8220;average looking&#8221;
girls in my life, but it goes even further. </p>
</ol>
<li class="L3">Possible implementations <ol>
<li class="L4">Predetermine my behaviour <ol>
<p class="P5">Predetermine how to react to people who don&#8217;t care about me.
This has its pros and cons. I have done this before. </p>
</ol>
<li class="L4">Just relax and trust myself <ol>
<p class="P5">Adopt the relaxed mindset and trust myself to respond on the
spot. I have done this before as well and it does have its
pros and cons too. </p>
</ol>
<li class="L4">Comments <ol>
<p class="P5">The above are not mutually exclusive; in fact they are
likely to benefit one another, and address one another&#8217;s
cons. </p>
</ol>
</ol>
</ol>

<li class="L2">Birthday Resolution <ol>
<li class="L3">Pay attention to the &#8220;average looking&#8221; girls in my life <ol>
<p class="P4">I think I have been simply ignoring many of the &#8220;average
looking&#8221; girls that I meet everyday. I have also been paying an
unwarranted amount of attention to the girls whom I deem to be
&#8220;good looking&#8221;.
</p>
<p class="P4">
It is the seemingly small things that I do that eventually
manifest into this trait of differential treatment. I think this
wrong and is unhealthy for the girls as well. How would someone
feel if most of the other sex ignore them? Conversely, how would
someone feel if many from the other sex continuously pay
unwarranted amounts of attention to them? </p>

<li class="L2">Observation <ol>
<p class="P3">Exercise seems to make me feel confident as well. Perhaps it is due
to the endorphins released? Perhaps it is due to the feeling of
mastery and improvement I get? Or the experience of bodily control
movement? Maybe it the the laughter, and application of
sportsmanly behavious while playing team sports? </p>

<li class="L2">Observation <ol>
<p class="P3">I notice that my speech and emotions are most stable when I am sleep
deprived.
</p>
<p class="P3">
Perhaps it is due to spending most of my formative years (especially
my Junior College years) in a sleep deprived state. Maybe I do not
yet know how to handle the additional awareness, sensations,
thoughts, feelings, etc. that I get when well rested. Maybe it is
becasue I become somewhat carefree and less safety conscious when
sleep deprived.
</p>
<p class="P3">
Further, it is ironic that I have been carefully safeguarding my
sleep cycles for quite a while (more than two years) now.
</p>
<p class="P3">
The solution is not to go back to the sleep deprived state. Rather
perhaps, I could work on keeping a controlled, slightly
sleep-deprived state, and work on transferring favourable aspects
back into my well-rested state of life? </p>

<li class="L2">Idea <ol>
<p class="P3">I want to accept the way I feel in any situation. I want to feel
that the butterflies in my stomach, and the readily perceptible
shots of adrenaline by my adrenal glands, are just part of my body
reacting appropriately to the situation.
</p>
<p class="P3">
Whatever, my bodily reaction, I can accept it and can still speak,
even if I have to make significant and rapid variations in my mouth,
breathing, and bodily movements to do so. </p>
</ol>
</ol>
<li class="L1">2009-07 <ol>
<li class="L2">Idea <ol>
<p class="P3">Tell Valarie (my former speech therapist) about the speech literacy
point of view. Get copies of my before and after therapy videos
from her.
</p>
<li class="L3">Want <ol>
<p class="P4">Record physiological differences between my &#8216;fluent&#8217; and
stuttery states. Practice to put fluent state physiology (heart
beat, back curvature, chest / diaphragm breathing, facial and
bodily expressions </p>
</ol>
</ol>
<li class="L2">Explore <ol>
<li class="L3">Managing multiple acquaintances </ol>
</ol>
<li class="L1">2009-06-28 <ol>
<li class="L2">Observation <ol>
<p class="P3">I seem to speak well in centain short (canned?) situations:
Introductions with shaking hands, when asking personal questions in
a conversation, etc. It appears to be similar to a child being able
to only answer canned queries. </p>
</ol>
<li class="L2">Idea <ol>
<li class="L3">Multiple Literacies <ol>
<p class="P4">Maybe my speech literacy is still like that of a child or a
teen. For much of my childhood and my teenhood it has often been
stressful to speak and that may have greatly hampered bettering
my speech to the skill of an adult.
</p>
<p class="P4">
Improving my speech literacy is probably going to require me
involving myself in various speaking situations and reviewing
them continuously.
</p>
<p class="P4">
One idea could be to model the process by which I improved my
writing skills and my mindset about writing itself:
I used to think I was bad at writing, mainly because of school.
Fortunately, I got authoritative perspectives from a book about
writing that writing is an iterative process. Unlike in school,
in the real world, one goes through several drafts and changes
before settling on a final piece. </p>
</ol>
</ol>
</ol>
<li class="L1">2009-05-29 <ol>
<li class="L2">Experience <ol>
<p class="P3">I felt nervous to ask a question yesterday and today at a
permaculture talk with about 50 people in the audience. It was good
that I actually just went ahead and asked today.
</p>
<p class="P3">
One of the presenters, Gutier, very observantly noted that I was
simply nervous and that I stopped breathing while I was trying to
speak.
</p>
<p class="P3">
He then reminded me of relaxation breathing&#8212;inhaling from the
diaphragm till the tip of the lungs, and exhaling the air from the
mouth with an exhaling sound. One could stand up and raise one&#8217;s
hands above one&#8217;s head to inhale in a greater volume of air.
</p>
<p class="P3">
I wanted to get back to adopting a certain emotional state when I
get nervous, but I think that it may be healthier to just keep it
simple and positive by identifying it as nervousness and overcoming
it with relaxation breathing. </p>
</ol>
</ol>
<li class="L1">2009-05-28 <ol>
<li class="L2">Did <ol>
<li class="L3">Took first videos of my speech <ol>
<p class="P4">I filmed it by holding my handphone in front of my face.
I did the filming while walking back home from Pasir Ris MRT. </p>
</ol>
</ol>
<li class="L2">Observation <ol>
<p class="P3">Realised that I am self-conscious of being filmed. Also realised
that I don&#8217;t stutter when I speak in a condescending tone.
</p>
<p class="P3">
Maybe I don&#8217;t know how to speak &#8216;normally&#8217; in say, small talk or
non-emotional, factual questioning and presentating. Maybe I only
know how to speak in emotional situations and factual situations
that also invoke strong emotions in me. </p>
</ol>
</ol>
<li class="L1">2009-05-20 <ol>
<li class="L2">Thought <ol>
<p class="P3">I don&#8217;t want my stuttering to be solved. It humbles me. </p>
</ol>
<li class="L2">Idea <ol>
<p class="P3">Maybe I can use different methods to manage my stuttering in
different situations. I face a dilemma in choosing an appropriate
method in several situations.
</p>
<p class="P3">
It is possible to use one for conversations and one for public
speaking, with a clear separation between the two. </p>
</ol>
</ol>
<li class="L1">2009-05-12 <ol>
<li class="L2">Thought <ol>
<p class="P3">My stuttering may also have to do with not wanting to make a mistake
in what I say. When I write I reword and rephrase often, but in
conversations, I don&#8217;t yet know how to do that.
</p>
<p class="P3">
In my local culture, there is an unacceptance of failure and a
fear of unproportionate reprecussions from saying the &#8216;wrong&#8217;
things. That may be making me unsure and afraid of how to speak. </p>
</ol>
</ol>
<li class="L1">2009-05-09 <ol>
<li class="L2">Observation <ol>
<p class="P3">There is also a panic attack element in my stuttering. Suddenly, I
will panic that I will block and will not be able to communicate my
message. I can even feel both my adrenaline glands giving a shot of
adrenaline. This fear also obstructs my thoughts and make me slow
witted for its duration. </p>
</ol>
<li class="L2">Observation <ol>
<p class="P3">My stuttering also has to do with my loudness and way of speaking.
If I speak louder and from the diaphragm, I seem to stutter less. </p>
</ol>
</ol>
<li class="L1">2009-05-01 <ol>
<li class="L2">Observation <ol>
<p class="P3">I feel I stutter much less when I speak with emotion. Conversely,
I seem to no know or have forgotten how to speak properly in
situations that do not arouse emotions in me.
Anxiety seems to have filled these emotionally void situations as
the &#8220;default emotion&#8221;. </p>
</ol>
<li class="L2">Thought <ol>
<p class="P3">What other emotions could I feel as my &#8220;default emotion&#8221;? I also
wish to highlight that other factors significant affect my
stuttering as well.
</p>
<li class="L3">Perception 2009-10-06 <ol>
<p class="P4">Maybe this has to do with Mindfulness&#8212;living in the present,
and focusing on the current task that I am involved in.
I do tend to ruminate about the pre-supposed consequences of
stuttering while speaking. This definitely makes my stutter
worse, as I as basically trying to handle several tasks at the
same time. </p>
</ol>
</ol>
</ol>
<li class="L1">2009-04-28 <ol>
<li class="L2">Observation <ol>
<p class="P3">My stuttering also has to do with my self-esteem.
A large part of my self-image is based on me feeling that others
find me sexy. I feel this is very superficial and am ashamed to talk
to others about it. It seems that a few small failures can quickly
change my self-image. </p>
</ol>

<li class="L2">Thought <ol>
<p class="P3">Stuttering shows one that there is always more than one way to get
something done. In fact, the novelty from alternate methods may even
make one stand out. </p>
</ol>
</ol>
<li class="L1">2009-04-03 <ol>
<li class="L2">Observation <ol>
<p class="P3">Realised that my stuttering occurrences, thoughts, and feelings are
dynamic. Small incidents can change my perspectives towards and
sense of meaning with regards to stuttering. However, it is also
true that for large timespans, there is negligible change in the
state of my stuttering occurrences, thought, and feelings.
</p>
<li class="L3">Perception 2009-10-06 <ol>
<p class="P4">I think I was commenting about the instability and
unpredictability of my stuttering condition. While there would
be little of gradual change most of the time, there is always
the potential of a sudden, huge change towards an unexpected
direction. </p>
</ol>

<li class="L2">Thought <ol>
<p class="P3">Stuttering creates a nothing to lose situation. </p>
</ol>
</ol>
<li class="L1">2009-01-31 <ol>
<li class="L2">Experience <ol>
<p class="P3">Today, I felt afraid to advise students from a primary school who
were collection donations. I wanted to say that they should know
some details about the beneficiaries, and wanted to ask them for
their school&#8217;s name so as to feedback this to their principal. </p>
</ol>
</ol>
<li class="L1">2009-01 <ol>
<li class="L2">Comment <ol>
<p class="P3">I am paralysed by fear when I speak to people. I feel the same when
I do things outside my home that I feel are right. I feel as though
someone is out there to get me when I do things that are not
perfectly in line with my view of Singapore society. </ol>
