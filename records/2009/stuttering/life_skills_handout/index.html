<p class="P2">Many psychologists believe that being conscious of each and every moment
of one&#8217;s life is an effective way of living one&#8217;s life fully.
Mindfulness helps people gain such consciousness. It has been said that

to master other life skills covered in this booklet.
</p>
<p class="P2">
This section discusses the three states of mind, namely the rational
mind, the emotional mind, and the wise mind. The wise mind is identified

one feels helpless or just cannot make things better right away.

<p class="P2">
Distraction and relaxation are among the skills elaborated by the

</ol>
</ol>
<li class="L1">Emotion Regulation <ol>
<p class="P2">Emotions are often misunderstood. Feelings are frequently viewed as
being completely separate from thoughts and behaviours. In fact,
thoughts and feelings co-exist and interact within us. They influence
each other, causing us to behave in certaion ways.
</p>
<p class="P2">
On the outset, this section clarifies the myths often attributed to
emotions. A sub-section on some common ways that emotions can make
people ineffective follows, and covers depression, anxiety, and anger.
</p>
<p class="P2">
The first set of emotion regulation skills focuses on learning to
evaluate thoughts and belieds that have an impact in feelings. These are
summarized in the acronym ABC-DEF derived from Cognitive Behaviour
Therapy (CBT), a proven way of helping people suffering from depression
and anxiety. The second set of skills, summarized in the acronym PLEASE
MASTER, aim to help in strengthening the &#8220;wise mind&#8221; by avoiding the
heavy reliance on the &#8220;emotional mind&#8221;.
</p>
<li class="L2">Myths about Emotions <ol>
<li class="L3">There is a right way to feel in every situation
<li class="L3">Letting others know that I am feeling bad is a weakness
<li class="L3">Negative feelings are bad and destructive
<li class="L3">Being emotional means being out of control
<li class="L3">Emotions can just happen for no reason
<li class="L3">Some emotions are really stupid
<li class="L3">All painful emotions are a result of bad attitude
<li class="L3">If others don&#8217;t approve of my feelings, I obviously shouldn&#8217;t feel the way I do
<li class="L3">Other people are the best judge of how I am feeling
<li class="L3">Painful emotions are not really important and should be ignored </ol>
<li class="L2">When Feelings Become Ineffective <ol>
<li class="L3">Depression <ol>
<p class="P4">People&#8217;s moods often change. Sadness and happiness both have a
role in people&#8217;s lives. When faced with life&#8217;s struggles,
setbacks and disappointment, most people will feel down for a
while, and then usually move on, having learned from one&#8217;s
experiences. When these painful feelings persist, interfering
with one&#8217;s ability to work, study, eat, sleep and have fun, this
is when depression may have set in.
</p>
<p class="P4">
People with depression remember negative aspects of their
experiences more readily than positive or neutral aspects. They
interpret their lives with a negative bias, a pattern with
maintains their depressed moods. People with depression usually
have negative thoughts about self (self-criticisms), about the
world (general negativity), and about the future (hopelessness).
</p>
<li class="L4">Being Effective with Depression <ol>
<li class="L5">Cognitive restructuring (ABC-DEF)
<li class="L5">Medication
<li class="L5">Improving interpersonal relationships
<li class="L5">Self care
<li class="L5">Activity scheduling </ol>
</ol>
<li class="L3">Anxiety <ol>
<p class="P4">When faced with challenging times, a typical physical reaction
of most people is to generate more energy to get ready to deal
with necessary demands, This physical arousal that is
experienced as nervousness or anxiety may initially help people
deal with tense situations in the office, study harder for an
exam, or keep focused on an important speech. When such states
of arousal become excessive, irrational dread of everyday
situations, however, it can become a disabling form of anxiety or
even panic. Thoughts that accompany such anxiety or panic are
perceptions of danger, threat and being vulnerable in some way.
</p>
<p class="P4">
The perception of danger/vulnerability may have helped people
through evolution and possibly as even as children to survive by
enabling the recognition of early warning signs to potential
danger. As adults in modern society, re-evaluating the
relevance of these reactions may be necessary. People may need
to see if one&#8217;s response is reasonably proportionate to the
potential danger of the actual situation one faces.
</p>
<p class="P4">
People who suffer from bouts of anxiety or panic tend to avoid
situations that cause such unpleasant feelings. With avoidance
comes immediate decrease in anxiety; however, the more one
avoids a situation, the more anxious one becomes about facing it
in the future. As such, this strategy in not sustainable.

<li class="L6">Developing alternative thoughts </ol>
<li class="L5">Behavioural strategies </ol>
</ol>
<li class="L3">Anger <ol>
<p class="P4">Anger is linked to a perception of damage or hurt and a belief
that important rules have been violated. People generally become
angry when they think that they have been treated unfairly, hurt
unnecessarily, or prevented from achieving a goal. In many
modern situations, however, outright aggression is often
considered inappropriate. Finding more appropriate avenues to
express the energies that anger brings is often helpful.

<p class="P3">This set of CBT skills are helpful in thinking more realistically
about the situations that present themselves. They are anchored
on changing one&#8217;s thinking (distorted thoughts) in order to
produce desired changes in affect (emotion) and behaviour.
Learning to recognise one&#8217;s distorted and unrealistic thought
and beliefs will contribute to more balanced thinking and mood
states.

<li class="L5">Question 2: What presumptions and beliefs underlie these thoughts? </ol>
<li class="L4"><strong>C</strong>onsequent Feelings <ol>
<li class="L5">As a result of the thoughts and beliefs triggered by the activating event, feelings quickly surface
<li class="L5">The feelings often intensify as thoughts and beliefs reinforce them
