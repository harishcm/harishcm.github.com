<li class="L1">Background and reflection <ol>
<p class="P2">I am a stutterer. Stuttering makes up a significant part of who I am.
There are many techniques out there designed to help stutterers.
</p>
<p class="P2">
I have tried <em>smooth speech</em> before. Unfortunately, I could not cope
with the markedly different way of speaking I had to cultivate. I had to
always focus on how I spoke, I had to stick to a certain few slangs, and
worst of all, I had to change my personality somewhat. It was effective
for presentations and formal settings. But for casual and friendly
interactions, I had to change so much of what I was, or of how I would
behave. Well, the good thing is that I no longer take casual and
friendly interactions for granted.
</p>
<p class="P2">
Sometimes I feel like improving myself, other times I feel that I should
accept myself, at other times I feel that others should accept me
unconditionally with or without my stuttering. </p>
</ol>
<li class="L1">Components of stuttering <ol>
<li class="L2">Blocks
<li class="L2">Word/syllable repetition
<li class="L2">Word/syllable prolongation
<li class="L2">Anxiety
<li class="L2">Depression?
<li class="L2">Improper breathing patterns
<li class="L2">Improper posture <ol>
<li class="L3">Stooping </ol>
</ol>
<li class="L1">Issues <ol>
<li class="L2">What should my &#8216;default&#8217; emotion be like? <ol>
<li class="L3">Healthy skepticism <ol>
<p class="P4">While I wish to learn from everyone and make everyone around me
happy, I should retain a healthy amounts of skepticism regarding
the way people approach, interact and judge me. </p>
</ol>
</ol>
<li class="L2">How should I approach my stuttering? <ol>
<li class="L3">Domineering approach <ol>
<p class="P4">I do not accept fear in any situation. In any situation, I will
just go in and manage my stuttering on the spot. I only take the
positives and no negatives from any situation. </p>
</ol>
<li class="L3">Acceptance approach <ol>
<p class="P4">This is me. Certain people will interact with me in certain ways
in certain situations. I should recognise these different
interactions and manage them. Of course, I cannot expect the
best even for most of the time, but really it doesn&#8217;t matter
much. </p>
</ol>
<li class="L3">Indifference approach <ol>
<p class="P4">Of course I have no problem. I can speak like everyone else. So
just speak. Everyone stutters once in a while. So what? </p>
</ol>
<li class="L3">Elitist approach <ol>
<p class="P4">I am better than the people around me. Everyone around me is
pretty dumb for doing what they are doing. I don&#8217;t need to
accept the people around me for who they are. So I can&#8217;t care
about how the people around me feel. </p>
</ol>
<li class="L3">Rights approach <ol>
<p class="P4">Just as people have a right to life, I have a right to stutter.
Since I have a right to stutter, both others and I have to
accept all stutterers when they do stutter. </p>
</ol>
<li class="L3">Speaking slowly and clearly approach <ol>
<p class="P4">I heard this on a drama series on television. The protagonist
was advising her friend who, at the last minute, wanted to
withdraw from a public debate because her nerves got the better
of her, that she had already practiced several times what she
wanted to say, and all she had to do was to speak slowly and
clearly. It stuck a chord with me, as unlike the approaches
above, it was non-judgemental, and plain and simple, yet
likely to be just as or more effective than the approaches above. </p>
</ol>
<li class="L3">Ask &#8220;Why?&#8221;, not &#8220;How?&#8221; approach <ol>
<p class="P4">This approach looks into the motivations behind working to
address stuttering. It is a lot of hard work to address
stuttering, and it is a challenging endeavour, right from the
start. To a stutterer, addressing stuttering is an
ill-defined problem, rather than a clearly defined one. In other
words, addressing stuttering is not simply a problem of learning
or practising to &#8220;speak normally&#8221;. It cannot be approaching by
only asking &#8220;How?&#8221;. One needs to be asking &#8220;Why?&#8221; first.
</p>
<p class="P4">
There are at least two reasons for this. Firstly, what is
&#8220;normal&#8221; in speech is itself arbitrary.
everyone stutters occasionally and certain intense situations
can trigger stuttering even in a non-stutterer. Normal is
often a constant interplay between the judgement of others, and
standards that one sets for oneself. Unfortunately,
normal could be easily misconstructed by both stutterers
and non-stutterers as &#8220;perfection&#8221;. Perfection is too high a
standard and an unreasonable expectation for both stutterers and
non-stutterers.
</p>
<p class="P4">
The secondly, and perhaps more importantly, looking at
stuttering as a clearly defined problem lends itself to
<em>covert stuttering</em>, which is a personal choice, but can also be
viewed upon as a form of cover up, i.e. &#8220;if you can&#8217;t make it, fake it&#8221;.
To a non-stutterer, covert stuttering may be a problem solved,
but to a stutter, it demands continual sidestepping and
skirting, and imposes a huge emotional burden of dealing with
the uncertainty, lack of control and fear of being &#8220;discovered&#8221;.
It also makes the act of speaking in common everyday situations
an intensely emotional experience, each and every time. A
problem &#8220;solved&#8221; thus leads to other, possibly larger, problems.
</p>
<p class="P4">
Asking and answering &#8220;Why?&#8221; first, before asking
&#8220;How?&#8221;, can help with establishing useful and fitting goals
for the individual, based on the individual&#8217;s desires. Answers to
&#8220;Why?&#8221; can also provide a constant positive push to along the long
and challenging journey of addressing stuttering, and become in
themselves, part of the solution. </p>
</ol>
<li class="L3">Physical intelligence and voluntary stuttering approach <ol>
<p class="P4">This approach attempts to address stuttering, from a more
holistic point of view&#8212;looking at speech as a form of
&#8220;physical intelligence&#8221;, and using voluntary stuttering to
establish a norm during conversations. There are three parts to
the approach.
</p>
<li class="L4">To have a sense of elegance and poise with regards to my posture <ol>
<p class="P5">But elegance and poise, I mean the kind that is natural and
makes one feel comfortable and at ease, not the pompous and
pretentious kind. A good posture improves speech, but more
holistically, a person with greater physical intelligence
should be able to stand, sit, move and speak with greater ease. </p>
</ol>
<li class="L4">To think of my body as a musical instrument, and feel the resonance in different parts of my body <ol>
<p class="P5">It is easiest to see the resonance in action when one is
humming or singing a tune. One can resonate or talk/sing
from different parts of the body, from the abdomen upwards,
to the chest, neck, face, nose, and even head (head&#8212;e.g.
Chinese Opera). For speech, it is usually most comfortable
to resonate in the abdomen, and the lower pitch sounds more
formal, for both men and women. </p>
</ol>
<li class="L4">To use voluntary stuttering in my interactions with people <ol>
<p class="P5">I am not going to be perfect, and aiming for perfection is
like chasing fools&#8217; gold. Voluntary stuttering makes the
stutterer in control of his/her voluntary stutters, and allows
the stutterer to control the non-verbal interactions during
these periods of stuttering. Through the voluntary stutters,
the stutter can establish a norm for the conversation. In
this way, tensions are eased for the stutter, and the other
party is aware of the stuttering from the beginning and can
respond and relate without confusion. </p>
</ol>
</ol>
</ol>
</ol>
<li class="L1">Aims <ol>
<li class="L2">Keep a <a href="./journal/">journal</a> of related experiences
<li class="L2">Look for patterns
<li class="L2">Look for ideas
<li class="L2">Experiment with ideas and combinations of them
<li class="L2">Choose and apply stable stuttering management technique(s) </ol>
<li class="L1">Techniques <ol>
<li class="L2">View videos of myself stuttering
<li class="L2">Looking into people&#8217;s face and eyes when speaking <ol>
<p class="P3">I notice that I developed a habit of looking downwards or closing my
eyes when stuttering while speaking to people.
</p>
<p class="P3">
At an interview, I realised that looking directly into the faces and
eyes of people I was talking to seemed to make the message get
across better. Also, it seemed to prevent individuals I talked
to from getting surprised or smirking while I was talking. Most
importantly, it made me feel better. All this, while I was
blocking, and saying &#8220;um&#8221; frequently, with long pauses between
words.
</p>
<p class="P3">
This is an interesting observation that I wish to explore further.
Perhaps, each individual I was talking to realised that he/she was
being looked at as well, and that he/she was being judged for
his/her behaviour and responses. When I closed my eyes however, they
may have not had this feeling, or may have felt that they could be
themselves as no one (including me) was looking at them.
</p>
<p class="P3">
There is probably quite a lot I can learn regarding this from
social-scientific concepts such as &#8220;the gaze&#8221;&#8212;the politics of
looking. Experimenting and learning more about eye contact would
definitely help. </p>
</ol>
<li class="L2">Deep breathing and relaxing the spine and diaphragm <ol>
<p class="P3">Deep breathing exercises that I have found useful were those in
which I had let air fill and stretch both my lungs and all my
diaphragm all the way to their maximum capacity and then letting the
air out. It seems that there is a considerable feeling of relaxation
when deep breaths result in the portions of the diaphragm attached
to the spine being stretched and relaxed. </p>
</ol>
<li class="L2">Visualisation <ol>
<p class="P3">Visualisation is a form of mental rehearsal for subsequent
performances, including conversations, discussions and
presentations. It has been helpful in the past, especially in the
days leading up to a major event. Visualisations seem to also help
me set the overarching issues such as the tome and style of
delivery, the emotions that I would be feeling, the thoughts I would
be having, and the actions and body language that I would be using.
Visualisations need focus and concentration in clearing the mind of
confusion and occluded thoughts. </p>
</ol>
</ol>
<li class="L1">Explore <ol>
<li class="L2">Managing multiple acquaintances
<li class="L2">Eye contact dynamics
<li class="L2">Politics of looking <ol>
<li class="L3">Social-scientific concept of &#8220;the gaze&#8221; </ol>
</ol>
<li class="L1">Acquaintances <ol>
<li class="L2">Talking instead of smiling <ol>
<p class="P3">I noticed that my coursemates I have not talked to before do
not seem to respond well to my smiles. However, when I talk to
them, they seem to respond well. Perhaps I should maintain
acquaintanceships with chats rather than with smiles. And it
appears that I do not need to smile much while talking either.
This may actually make my life easier. </p>
</ol>
<li class="L2">Complimenting others <ol>
<p class="P3">I still cannot compliment people immediately and wholeheartedly when
I feel something is good. I used to not be able to recognise the
achievements of others at all. But now I can, and I have <em>started</em>
complimenting. </p>
</ol>
<li class="L2">Carrying out social interactions with most girls <ol>
<p class="P3">I am overly concerned about what the interactions might
eventually lead to. I am also overly concerned about what others
may think when they see me in the interaction. I feel that both
are unhealthy and unnecessary concerns.
</p>
<li class="L3">Things I am confused about <ol>
<li class="L4">What sorts of words to use
<li class="L4">What sort of things to talk about </ol>
<li class="L3">Exceptions <ol>
<li class="L4">Female friends who are attached to other friends
<li class="L4">Girls significantly taller than me </ol>
</ol>
</ol>
<li class="L1">Factors improving my speech <ol>
<li class="L2">Sleep deprivation <ol>
<p class="P3">I seem to stutter less when I am sleep deprived.
</p>
<li class="L3">Possible implementation <ol>
<p class="P4">Transfer favourable aspects of my sleep deprived state to my
well-rested state. </p>
</ol>
</ol>
<li class="L2">Exercise <ol>
<p class="P3">I feel more confident when I spend a considerable part of my
daily life exercising. </p>
</ol>
<li class="L2">Consciously adopting a relaxed mindset <ol>
<p class="P3">This works, but is usually confined to a short time period&#8212;from
minutes to hours to occationally days. However, building a habit of
adopting a relaxed mindset is likely to be a sustainable and
successful endeavour.
</p>
<li class="L3">Possible challenges <ol>
<li class="L4">Controlling the &#8216;relaxedness&#8217; <ol>
<p class="P5">Several times I have ended up being &#8220;too relaxed&#8221; but the
people around me seem to like it, though I felt concerned
that I was not treating them well by being too relaxed.
Perhaps it is an unwarranted concern. </p>

<li class="L3">Perception 2011-09-21 <ol>
<p class="P4">By &#8220;Hollywood Standards&#8221;, the movie was not dramatic
enough, but I felt that it tried to portray a stutterer
accurately, while trying to keep the audience entertained at
the same time. To me, several scenes were nostalgic,
bringing back memories of the times that I too felt that I
had to perform something very well. I too had thought of
and put in place modifications, alterations and coping
strategies to overcome stuttering, and deliver a good
performance. I too have had in situations in which I had to
deliver a speech or a performance to an audience that shared
an emotional bond with me, and it had come out remarkably
well. As is usual in many movies, it was a happy ending.
The protagonist achieved self-actualisation of his purpose
in his speeches to the public at the time when Britain went
to war with Germany. On a personal note again, the movie
showed a model of overcoming stuttering that I had
subscribed to in the past, but one that I wish to move away
from. The above model may let one achieve remarkable feats,
but is less useful in the more mundane situations and
performances of day to day life, in which one only needs to
perform adequately, but consistently, and if less
preparation is required, the time freed up can be used for
other activities. </p>

tilt the head lower so that the spine, tendons and muscles are
able to pull on each other and achieve a stable tensile
