also, i just saw the link to your self-directed learning page... when did you take the sabbatical? Is it on-going? Do you have more notes/resources offline that you collated from your self-directed learning projects?
It seems like an awesome project!

thanks Dhawal!!

yup for notes i've got a lot of backlog in archiving them into electronic form.. it's one of the problems i'm trying to solve, haha..

also i've not uploaded resources in pdfs and such for copyright reasons, though i've tried... to link to them on the net as much as possible...

anything you interested in particular? :)

your ambidexterity training project feels cool.. your personal finance project details would be very interesting to me since I am a fool in that dept. and beam robotics would be awesome - since I am interested in the field of robotics too (...can't say I'm exploring it much right now though).

I want to know what you hope to achieve with your blog - what sort of growth it is seeing and how you are progressing with all your projects (the small snippets somehow left me feeling like there was a lot I wasn't being made privvy to).

Cheers!

the ambidexterity thing, started off with fooling around, then it got pretty exciting.. we really take our writing abilities for granted. we took years to get the control, neatness, etc.. and the micro control we have, that takes the longes......t man.. i think i write like an 8-10 year old with my left.. haha..

personal finance: i think reading the rich dad, poor dad book is a good start. i really like his pictorial explanation of what an asset is (something that brings you income, passively), what is a liability (something that causes you expenses, passively).. other basic concepts are

* expenses come after deducting savings from income; not savings come after deducting expenses from income...
* if you are in debt, try to transfer as much debt to the lowest interest bearing source, and start by paying off the highest interest bearing source first..

i found it very helpful to check out philosophies and perspectives about money: what it is, how it works, how it's created and destroyed, etc.. i've listed resources under &lt;http://harish.19thsc.com/records/2006/foundations_of_economies/&gt;.. the Cybercash book by Robert Guttman was an interesting survey about the attempts by various people/companies to create electronic money: their failures, issues, background, etc...

robotics/beam robotics: i didn't really do much more than what I've written in the blog page.. haha.. it's something i'm interested in too, but didn't explore much.. any resources you think i should check out? have you built any beam bots?மேலும் பார்க்க

Well, for the current state of the website, I have two aims.

One is to introduce self-directed learning, and its associated concepts.. I want to demystify and diffuse misconceptions about it.. I hope that I have written the Framework and ans...wered the FAQs in an accessible manner.. Have I??

Two is to give a real life example what of records from someone's learning pursuits may be like. Especially so to give a localised example: in Singapore, by a person schooled in mainstream schools.

It seems to me that many of us (in Singapore) feel positively towards self-directed learning, self-determination, etc., but socially there seems to be resistance towards its randomness, lack of structure, qualifications and control.

There are also other aims: use it to ascertain credibility for my individual learning pursuits (sort of grading individual learning projects), for input from others, to stimulate discussion/collaboration on interests. I'm still trying to figure out how to include such stuff...

Growth... The Records online are an archival and categorization of what I've recorded on paper. There's a lot of backlog. I used to spend a lot of time trying to get the website up. Now, I can probably spend more time archiving... haha! Maybe I should start having a weekly or daily archival session, instead of when I feel like it...

I'm thinking about another section: something like 'Tips' or 'Issues' or 'Articles' to discuss about more specific stuff in greater detail. Things like "Uncovering resources", "Facing resistance", etc.. Would you be interested in any specific issues in particular?

Small snippets... Thanks for pointing this out to me! :) Some learning projects, like family finances, I did not upload online. But for those that are online, the journals and outlines are what I have. Looks like I should have more extensive categorization, and communicate it better...

May I ask, what do you think gives makes you feel that you are not privy to a lot of stuff? How do you think I should bring across that that's all I have for now? Wikipedia does "This article is a stub. ... " Hmm...

Forgot to tell you, I took the sabbatical after my 1st year at uni (i was on leave from mid-2007 to mid-2008)..

Thanks for the feedback man!! Discussions like these are really really cool!

Yep... these sort of discussions are really cool. Well, yea, putting a "stub" would be useful like Wikipedia - or even better would be if you used more multimedia - put up video samples of your ambidexterity to add to your journal, photos of your robots (if you build them), plans - more links to external sites.

Your framework looks good and explains well how you approach problems but when does the self-directed learning end? How about a timeline?

Archiving is fine - but make sure it's searchable, at least through your site. I felt "not privy to info" due to the sparseness of the journal entries. The descriptions are very abrupt. A photo/video would speak a thousand words and more! (:

Keep at it dude... at least there is something keeping you motivated all the time! Cheers!

Harish Mohanadas
Thanks Dhawal :) ahh icic... okie... The sparseness and abrupt descriptions... hmm... I guess that many of my "journals" would more aptly be called "logs". Some are actual journals, such as the "failures" journal, but most were meant to be ...just short entries to indicate events.

Also, for too long, the only person i kept the records for was myself. And that's how I write for myself, haha! There was (and still is) a need to be able to write the records as quickly as possible... The log entries are an expense, or a chore, but they are useful in the long run. Reflections, and descriptions on the other hand are valuable when being written itself. hmm, perhaps I'll label them differently, or put them into different files. I'll check it out and think of some ideas. Thanks for bringing this up man! It really helps!

Haha, several others commented about the lack of multimedia too! As part of effective communication, it's something I've got to learn how to do well---drawings, photos, videos, visual communication in general---it's what makes the internet different from books. Also, multimedia reaches out to a greater audience than just plain text. Yup I'll improve on this :)

Yea, a search box for people to search through the website. I'll add one soon.

What do you mean by when does self-directed learning end? Did you mean something like when does one end a learning project? And the timeline: do you mean a generic one, or one for the learning pursuits I have been involved in?

Thanks for the well wishes dude! Hope things are going great for you!
