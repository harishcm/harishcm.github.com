<li class="L1">2011-10-02 <ol>
<li class="L2">Experiment <ol>
<li class="L3">Adding search functionality <ol>
<p class="P4">I finally realised how to set up Google Custom Search for
websites. I had previously spent a lot of time working out why
the Javascript code would not work on my webpages, only to
realise that the <code>htmlscrubber</code> plugin was removing it. </p>
</ol>
</ol>

<li class="L1">2011-05-22 <ol>
<li class="L2">Actions <ol>
<li class="L3">Added passport photo to About Page <ol>
<p class="P4">It would be better to put up a photo showing me in the process
of self-directed learning, but I put this one up as a temporary
measure. It was also a better taken photo that the one that I
had removed previously. </p>
</ol>
</ol>

<li class="L1">2011-05-18 <ol>
<li class="L2">Actions <ol>
<li class="L3">Increased <code>line-spacing</code> from 1.8em to 2em <ol>
<p class="P4">Increasing the <code>line-spacing</code> facilitates reading long
articles of text on monitor screens. Previously, I had reduced
it to 1.8em to save vertical space. I now think that saving
vertical space is not as important as improving readability.
Also, the increase in vertical space seems to be pretty minor. </p>

</ol>
</ol>
<li class="L1">2011-05-03 <ol>
<li class="L2">Actions <ol>
<li class="L3">Removed Photo from About page <ol>
<p class="P4">Felt that the photo was unnecessary. Vinod had told me to put up a
photo that showed me in the process of self-directed learning,
instead of a portrait. I agreed with him on the basis that the photo
that I put up is a significant part of the visual communication of
the website. Also, my Resume, which was linked to in the About page,
had my photo in it. </p>

<li class="L1">2011-03-26 <ol>
<li class="L2">Review of Website <ol>
<li class="L3">Pagetrail for pages under Framework <ol>
<p class="P4">A pagetrail of pages under the Framework section would be
effective in helping users to navigate from one component of the
Framework to the other. </p>
</ol>
<li class="L3">Recentchanges <ol>
<p class="P4">Having a list of recently changed pages will be the next step,
for repeat users to the website. Also, a list of changes will
allow repeat users to see what has changed since their last
visit, which could have been several weeks or months ago.
</p>
<p class="P4">
I would probably want the Recentchanges to be generated
automatically, probably through an Ikiwiki hook with Bazaar.
This would involve some experimentation and deliberation about
how the recent changes are presented. </p>
</ol>
<li class="L3">Map Div with nested directories <ol>
<p class="P4">The layout of the unordered lists may have to be modified
slightly. The Design Theme page has an example of such a
situation. </p>
</ol>
</ol>
<li class="L2">Future Plans <ol>
<li class="L3">Essays/Articles <ol>
<p class="P4">I plan to include a section where I write essays about
different, more in-depth aspects of self-directed learning, and
about my experiences, etc.. </p>
</ol>
<li class="L3">Colophon <ol>
<p class="P4">Include images of the prior art and tools I used. </p>
</ol>
<li class="L3">Resources <ol>
<p class="P4">Include cover images of books and articles, and screenshots
of websites. Visual images say a lot in a very quick time, and
it makes the presentation a lot more interesting. </p>
</ol>
<li class="L3">Influences <ol>
<p class="P4">This is a section through which I wanted to list out the major
sources of influence that I could recognise, regarding my
self-directed learning ideas and methodologies.
</p>
<p class="P4">
Maybe I should combine it with one of the existing sections,
but it may be able to stand alone, as a section by itself. </p>
</ol>
<li class="L3">Search <ol>
<p class="P4">The web search engines have now crawled my website. So, I could
probably tap on them to provide a search function for my
website. However, the newer changes would not have been crawled
by the search bots, so I would need to perhaps let the users
know about it, and perhaps direct them to the Recentchanges
page. </p>

<li class="L2">Experiment <ol>
<li class="L3">Placing the Records section into the Sidebar <ol>
<p class="P4">The current layout looks production ready. However, I am still
unsure if I would like to merge the changes into the main
branch.
</p>
<p class="P4">
For one, the records pages themselves are not really
ready for public viewing. On one hand they are simply there as
an example to what record keeping may look like. On the other
hand, making them public will motivate me to spruce up as many
of my learning projects and ad-hoc interests as possible. It
will also gretly help with collaboration. </p>
</ol>
</ol>
</ol>
<li class="L1">2010-12-28 <ol>
<li class="L2">Actions <ol>
<li class="L3">Added styling for horizontal rules <ol>
<p class="P4">For separating footnotes from body text. </p>
</ol>
<li class="L3">Changed border-left of blockquote to 2px from 1px <ol>
<p class="P4">More consistent with styling for horizontal rules. </p>
</ol>
</ol>
<li class="L2">Criticism from Vinod <ol>
<li class="L3">Website looks incomplete
<li class="L3">Find a way to make the most important messages very obvious
<li class="L3">Add links to other websites
<li class="L3">Include a comments box
<li class="L3">The website needs to be updated often to gain repeat visitors </ol>
<li class="L2">Probable Changes to Website <ol>
<li class="L3">Linking to the Resources section within the main Menu <ol>
<p class="P4">I should make the Resources section easy to navigate, and link
to it in the main Menu. This is one of the most important
sections. It would also partially address the issue of adding
links to other websites. </p>
</ol>
<li class="L3">Merging the Records section into the Sidebar <ol>
<p class="P4">I should also include in as many links to the Records section as
possible in the Sidebar. Perhaps, using only the map plugin
on the sidebar page will prevent excessive full wiki rebuilds.
Another idea which will also solve the problem of
differentiating between Learning Projects and Ad-hoc Interests
would be to explain a little about both of them within the
Sidebar itself. This should partially address the issue of the
website looking incomplete as well.
</p>
<p class="P4">
If I do implement the Sidebar as above, the Records page may
become redundant. Maybe I should just remove the Records page
altogether, including its entry in the main Menu. This of course
raises the issue of whether to bring the records up one level,
and how I should go about updating the search engines and
url redirects thereafter. </p>
</ol>
</ol>
<li class="L2">Possible Further Changes to Website <ol>
<li class="L3">Making space in the layout itself for the most important messages <ol>
<p class="P4">Another idea would be to make space for including the most
important messages in the layout itself.
One possible way would be making space for a subtitle.
Another way would be to make space for
quotes and statements, whether mine or others&#8217;. </p>
</ol>
<li class="L3">Adding a comments box for the entire website <ol>
<p class="P4">I am still not yet ready to add comments for each and every page
on the website. The main reason is that I will then have to deal
with dynamic or semi-dynamic content, which presents a whole new
level of challenges. I will also have to deal with issues such
as spam.
</p>
<p class="P4">
Nevertheless, the benefits of having users being able to post to
the website can the tremendous. It could help greatly in receiving
feedback about the website and its contents. It could possibly
help in establishing cooperative learning tie-ups.
</p>
<p class="P4">
A start could be to add a single comments box for the entire
website. This could be within the sidebar, or possibly on a page
by itself. </p>
</ol>

<li class="L1">2010-12-23 <ol>

<li class="L1">2010-12-22 <ol>
<li class="L2">Experiment <ol>
<li class="L3">Setting up Search for Website <ol>
<p class="P4">Experimented using the default search on ikiwiki&#8212;Xapian engine
and Omega frontend. I got it to work on Apache but I am still
facing problems with setting up FastCGI on Nginx. To properly
use it though, I have to find out how to improve CGI security on
Apache.
</p>
<li class="L4">Feelings 2010-12-22 <ol>
<p class="P5">I took a long experimenting with setting up FastCGI on
Nginx. I could not figure out how exactly to do it with the
documentation that was available on the wiki. The Apache
documentation was much clearer, and it was much easier to
set up CGI. It may be worthwhile to forgo the quickness and
small memory footprints of Nginx for the clearer
documentation of Apache. </p>
</ol>
</ol>
</ol>
</ol>
<li class="L1">2010-12-20 <ol>
<li class="L2">Merged Records <ol>
<li class="L3">Website Old Linear Records Format AND Website New Outline Records Format </ol>
<li class="L2">Experiment <ol>
<li class="L3">Running a Webserver on Amazon EC2 <ol>
<p class="P4">I am now familiar with starting up a virtual machine instance on
Amazon EC2. I managed to see the nginx test page.
</p>
<p class="P4">
Next would be to configure the web server, and find a way to
easily upload and sync the files for the website itself.
One possibility would be to use Amazon S3.
</p>
<p class="P4">
Another issue would be to set up a DNS servers, possibly using
Amazon&#8217;s static IP addresses. I could also use Afraid.org&#8217;s DNS
services with static or dynamic IP addresses.
</p>
<p class="P4">
I also have to find out about how to store the state of the
virtual machine between start-ups and shut-downs.
</p>
<p class="P4">
One bad experience so far has been that the documentation and
terminology of the Amazon Web Services is confusing. I wonder if
this would overshadow the benefits of so much more flexibility
when compared to a web host. </p>

<li class="L1">2010-07-22 <ol>
<li class="L2">Actions <ol>
<li class="L3">Changed border of links in subpages, tags and backlinks divs to 2px border-bottom <ol>
<p class="P4">It fits better with for a chalk and blackboard type of style. </p>
</ol>
<li class="L3">Added 2px padding-bottom to all links <ol>
<p class="P4">No unsightly line appears even when there is no anchor text, and
the spacing makes the link more prominent. </p>
</ol>
<li class="L3">Set imagelinks to simply display a border-bottom when hovered upon <ol>
<p class="P4">Suits the imagelinks well after the 2px padding-bottom was

</ol>
<li class="L3">Reverted display of paragraph and ul item in pageheader and pageinfo to block <ol>
<p class="P4">Improves visual appeal, especially when subpages wrap over to

<li class="L1">2010-07-14 <ol>
<li class="L2">Actions <ol>
<li class="L3">Set links in menu to simply display a border-bottom when hovered upon <ol>

</ol>
<li class="L1">2010-07-10 <ol>
<li class="L2">Actions <ol>
<li class="L3">Rolled back border-left on hover to only for ol elements <ol>
<p class="P4">This seems to be the more appropriate method for the information
that I wish to convey:
which heading is under which, and which is the top level
heading.
A hover-left for every outline element does not convey this
information as effectively. </p>
</ol>
<li class="L3">Changed border-left on hover from solid #444 to dashed #666 <ol>
<p class="P4">Seems more effective in staying out of sight when not necessary,
yet being prominent when one wishes to make use of them. </p>
</ol>
<li class="L3">Changed tint of body background texture from greyscale to #708090 <ol>
<p class="P4">Blended well with the link borders and stood out more than the
greyscale tint. </p>
</ol>
<li class="L3">Changed background texture of pageheader, content, pageinfo and pagefooter divs <ol>
<p class="P4">The previous horizontal lined texture seemed to interfere too
much with reading of text. The current texture is a paper-like
one that is more subtle. </p>
</ol>
<li class="L3">Removed 2px padding from all anchors except those in backlinks, subpages and tags divs <ol>
<p class="P4">Solves problem of unsightly line appearing when there is no
anchor text. </p>
</ol>
<li class="L3">Increased border-bottom of all anchors to 2px except those in backlinks, subpages and tags divs <ol>
<p class="P4">Makes links easier to identify while still not making the
display too overwhelming when many links are clustered together. </p>
</ol>
<li class="L3">Set whitespace in anchors in backlinks, subpages and tags divs to nowrap <ol>
<p class="P4">Solves problem of unsightly wrapping of links with all round
borders. </p>
</ol>
</ol>
<li class="L2">Experiment <ol>
<li class="L3">Border-radius to pageheader, content, pageinfo and pagefooter divs <ol>

<li class="L1">2010-07-04 <ol>
<li class="L2">Actions <ol>
<li class="L3">Included 0.5em margin below paragraphs <ol>
<p class="P4">Made it easier to differentiate between paragraphs. Also made
the paragraph layout more visually attractive. </p>
</ol>
<li class="L3">Set witdh of unordered lists in pageheader and pageinfo to auto <ol>
<p class="P4">These were inline lists and were more visually effective and
readable when on a single line or two lines at most. </p>
</ol>
<li class="L3">Removed justified alignment from paragraphs <ol>
<p class="P4">Several paragraphs looked unsightly, especially when the word
spacing between adjacent lines significantly differed. </p>
</ol>
<li class="L3">Set paragraphs and unordered lists in pageheader and pageinfo divs to inline <ol>
<p class="P4">Clearer presentation for the subpages divs. </p>
</ol>
<li class="L3">Added background textures for body, and pageheader, content, pageinfo and pagefooter divs <ol>
<li class="L4">Feelings <ol>
<p class="P5">It was pretty interesting to realise the huge differences in
mood that different textures could bring about, even
when they were all derived from the same colours. </p>
</ol>
<li class="L4">Comment <ol>
<p class="P5">The background image may have to be made darker and subtler
to make reading easier. It may even have to be removed for
the contents div. </p>

<li class="L2">Thought <ol>
<p class="P3">A colourful background image may be suitable for the pageheader.
This could represent the creative and exciting aspects of
self-directed learning. </p>

<li class="L3">Experimented with positioning in-text images <ol>
<p class="P4">I like the method of placing an image inside a table and
using the table&#8217;s caption as the image&#8217;s caption.
This method seems to be most suitable for floating images on the
right, so that the flow of text paragraphs will not be
interrupted. </p>

<p class="P4">Makes it clear that it is a blockquote. </p>
</ol>
<li class="L3">Changed width of preformatted text elements to 33em <ol>
<p class="P4">Makes it consitent with the paragraph elements.
</p>

</p>
<li class="L5">Initial Comment <ol>
<p class="P6">It seems alright for now, but I may wish to change it in
the future. </p>
</ol>
</ol>
</ol>
<li class="L3">Added preformatted text style rules for outlines <ol>
<p class="P4">Found a use for them as lists within body text blocks. </p>
</ol>
<li class="L3">Added border-left on hover for every outline element <ol>
<p class="P4">In preparation for using javascript commands for folding and
unfolding of outlines. Also, makes it easier to to discern
headings that have been broken up over two or more lines. </p>
</ol>
<li class="L3">Added ie7.js <ol>

<li class="L2">Experiment <ol>
<li class="L3">Justified text and indented paragraphs with no margin spacing in between <ol>
<p class="P4">The shapes of the paragraphs make it seem more attractive to
read. It also solves the problem of paragraph margins in the
outline pages.

<p class="P5">The justified text also seems ok so far. </p>
</ol>
</ol>

<li class="L1">2010-05-30 <ol>
<li class="L2">Actions <ol>
<li class="L3">Changed Line Spacing to 1.8em <ol>
<p class="P4">It saved vertical space on the page, allowing more content to be

the page. </p>
</ol>
<li class="L3">Removed Sidebar <ol>
<p class="P4">Did not go well after margins between divs were removed.
It was also duplicating information found on the Records
page, as it listed records tagged as learning projects.
I am no longer in favour of differentiating
my records into learning projects and ad-hoc interests, and
promoting ad-hoc interests into learning projects.
Instead, I am intending to tag and categorize them into according to
different themes. </p>

<p class="P4">Reduce space taken up by Pageheader. </p>
</ol>
<li class="L3">Reintroduced Parentlinks into Pageheader <ol>
<p class="P4">Serves well as a navigational aid and no longer causes space
issues as the logo has been made smaller. </p>
</ol>
<li class="L3">Felt <ol>
<p class="P4">Pretty weird that i took so long to realise that I can shrink
the logo, instead of removing content from the pageheader. </p>

<p class="P4">Reduce amount of space taken up by Pageheader. Also encourages
me to keep pages short and sweet. </p>
</ol>
<li class="L3">Themed Pageinfo div similar to Sidebar div <ol>
<p class="P4">Seems to give nicer overall look and feel. </p>
</ol>
</ol>
<li class="L2">Problem <ol>
<p class="P3">Text within square brackets in otl files are being treated as
imagelinks by the <code>otl2html</code> script.
This possibly affects several pages including the
<a href="../../tex_document_typesetting/">tex document typesetting</a> outline. </p>

</ol>
<li class="L1">2010-04-26 <ol>
<li class="L2">Actions <ol>
<li class="L3">Positioned Menu at top of page <ol>
<p class="P4">Found it to be more useable as this is the common location for a
menu. </p>
</ol>
<li class="L3">Removed Subpagelinks from Header <ol>
<p class="P4">The Subpagelinks made the Pageheader take up too much vertical
space after the Menu was added to the top of the page.
</p>
<p class="P4">
I also have ideas of moving Subpagelinks currently
in the Pageinfo div right to before the Contect div instead.
It is also possible to place the Pageinfo div on the right of
the Content div. Maybe a mix of both ideas? </p>
</ol>

<li class="L3">Solved problem of Subpagelinks causing vertical movement of page <ol>
<p class="P4">Absolutely placed Header div. </p>
</ol>
<li class="L3">Widened Pagecontent divs <ol>
<p class="P4">To accomodate future placement of images on the right of
paragraphs. Wider images can be centred on a new line instead. </p>
</ol>
<li class="L3">Removed all div floating properties <ol>
<p class="P4">Floating was not no longer useful after pagecontent divs were
made wider. </p>
</ol>
<li class="L3">Increased Sidebar heading font size <ol>
<p class="P4">More readable in this way. </p>
</ol>
</ol>
</ol>
<li class="L1">2010-02-12 <ol>
<li class="L2">Thought <ol>
<p class="P3">I think that list based outlines are better for brainstorming or
when there are several different issues in a single page or section.
It seems to be good for the Sparks pages.
</p>
<p class="P3">
For the learning projects though, a heading based outline may be
more suitable. Something that is closer to the markdown pages,
perhaps using Nicholas&#8217;s idea of a heading and one or two sentences
describing it. </p>
</ol>
<li class="L2">Want <ol>
<li class="L3">Clean up the generation of html lists from the otl files <ol>
<p class="P4">Makes the resulting html more standards-adhering and the CSS

<li class="L2">Criticism <ol>
<li class="L3">Colours are nice
<li class="L3">Needs more pictures and visual features such as flowcharts
<li class="L3">Logo is not obvious <ol>
<p class="P4">I had to prompt what I wanted it to be, and even then it was not
completely successful.
</p>
<li class="L4">Idea <ol>
<p class="P5">Cut the most prominent aspects of a face into the spiral
outline. It already has the flatness of the forehead.
Probably the nose is most important. Then mouth or eyes if
necessary. Chin may make it too obvious. </p>
</ol>
</ol>
</ol>
<li class="L2">Actions <ol>
<li class="L3">Lowered Parentlinks 1em below top of logo in header <ol>
<p class="P4">Looks more balanced. </p>

<p class="P4">Prevent up and down movement of Pagecontents when navigating
from a page without subpages to one with subpages and

<li class="L3">Added logo to website
<li class="L3">Changed menu to left and content to right <ol>
<p class="P4">Initially, there was too much spacing between the content
paragraphs and the menu links. Swapping their positions makes
them seem more integrated. </p>
</ol>
<li class="L3">Increased linespacing from 3ex to 2em <ol>
<li class="L4">Easier to scan text
<li class="L4">Necessary to avoid clutter when there are many backlinks

</ol>
<li class="L1">2010-01-19 <ol>
<li class="L2">Actions <ol>
<li class="L3">Solved float issues <ol>
<p class="P4">The trick was to create a pagecontent div that contained the
content and pageinfo divs. Then the menu, sidebar and other divs
could be floated next to the content div, while still
keeping the html accessible. </p>
</ol>
<li class="L3">Added colour to menu and sidebar <ol>

<li class="L2">Suggestions for improvement <ol>
<li class="L3">Clear differentiation between learning projects and ad-hoc interests <ol>
<p class="P4">For the sake of presentation, it would help to differentiate
between the well developed learning projects and the less and
undeveloped ad-hoc interests. </p>
</ol>
<li class="L3">Include more explanatory test <ol>
<p class="P4">Explanatory text makes the outline content more interesting.
It allows details to be brought out effectively, and facilitates
scanning by providing places for the eye to stop and read.
Complex ideas are perhaps better discussed in sentences as well. </p>
</ol>
</ol>
<li class="L2">Actions <ol>
<li class="L3">Increased body font size to 13px <ol>

<li class="L4">Sidebar rendering <ol>
<p class="P5">Sidebar is now rendered at the same time that other pages
are rendered. Map gives correct output. Inline is not tested
yet. </p>
</ol>
<li class="L4">Links <ol>
<p class="P5">Links are made absolute by appending the url and the dirname
of the sidebar page to all relative links. </p>
</ol>
</ol>
<li class="L3">Current problems <ol>
<li class="L4">Rebuilding pages after their initial sidebar page was removed <ol>
<p class="P5">Currently pages are being rebuilt, but bestlink to sidebar
still points to the removed sidebar. So sidebar content of
rebuilt pages remains the same until another refresh is
performed. This may be an IkiWiki bug itself. </p>
</ol>

<li class="L2">Exploration <ol>
<li class="L3">SSI based sidebar <ol>
<p class="P4">If I want to use SSI, I have to either use a .shtml
extension for all pages, or use the XBit Hack, or set all
html pages to be parsed for SSIs.
</p>
<p class="P4">
Maybe I should keep working on the sidebar plugin as well, as I
will probably remove the related pages from the sidebar. </p>
</ol>
<li class="L3">Related links below content div <ol>
<p class="P4">I can use the inline plugin with quick mode. Still it might be
slow but is worth a try. Maybe I should write a plugin to

<li class="L4">Sidebar rendering during needsbuild hook <ol>

</ol>
<li class="L4">Munging links relative to the different destination pages <ol>

<li class="L1">2009-09-14 <ol>
<li class="L2">Did <ol>
<li class="L3">Made colours brighter <ol>
<p class="P4">I realised that the colours looked really dull when I switched
from a werbsite with a white background to my website. </p>
</ol>
</ol>
<li class="L2">Thought <ol>
<p class="P3">Should I use Outlines for all pages in the website? The inclusion of
colours certainly makes the pages a lot more exciting to look at.
Plus, writing in an outline form seems to be much, much easier.
It is also possible that the outline indentations and colours will
help visitors scan for what they want easier.
</p>
<li class="L3">Issues <ol>
<li class="L4">Outlines are currently converted to lists <ol>
<p class="P5">Headings are more appropriate. Perhaps otl2tags can address
this? Also there seems to be new development on the
VimOutliner mailing list. </p>
</ol>
<li class="L4">VimOutliner&#8217;s link syntax <ol>
<p class="P5">I find that the link synatax to has low readability,
especially for long links, and worse if I want to show the
whole URL as it is. Seems like it also cannot escape the
syntax either. But I could possibly improve on the code in
otl2html and maybe even submit a patch! </p>

<li class="L4">Set the stage for implementation of folding
<li class="L4">Felt <ol>
<p class="P5">It took a really long time to experiment and debug the css. I
suspect the main reason is the non-standard html output of
the otl2html script.
</p>
<p class="P5">
The Apache::OTL module has another implementation of a otl
to html convertion. There has been talk in the VimOutliner
mailing list of merging the functionality of both otl2html
and Apache::OTL.
</p>
<p class="P5">
Maybe, just maybe, I could merge the two. But maybe an
easier and faster solution would be to make the otl2html
output more standards conformant. </p>

<li class="L3">Moved Website Journal to within the website tree itself </ol>
<li class="L2">Thought <ol>
<p class="P3">I guess using the inline directive for the sidebar would be a better

flexibility in sorting the headings and generating lists such as
&#8220;Most Recent&#8221; and the like. </p>

<li class="L5">Might be slower than the sidebar plugin itself! </ol>
<li class="L4">TOC directive <ol>
<p class="P5">The user&#8217;s experience when several pages are inlined one
after the other seem to be very different from what I want.
</p>
<p class="P5">
The positioning of the TOCs appears to be difficult as well.
I would probably need several identical TOCs to make the
page useable. Maybe, links back to the TOC after each
inlined page would make things better. But this would
require me to rethink the whole user&#8217;s experience again.
</p>
<p class="P5">
A CSS fixed positioned TOC wasn&#8217;t very appealing to me, and
it wasn&#8217;t very accessible. </p>

<p class="P4">Eric S. Raymond&#8217;s Personal Website. He is one of the pioneers of the
internet and his website is an excellent model for what I want to
achieve. </p>
</ol>
<li class="L3"><a href="http://www.fourmilab.ch">Fourmilab</a> <ol>
<p class="P4">Website of John Walker, co-writer of AutoCAD. May be another site I
can model mine upon. His website contains a collection of personal
writings and his reading list. </p>
</ol>
<li class="L3"><a href="http://www.autodidactproject.org">The Autodidact Project</a> <ol>
<p class="P4">A personal site by Ralph Dumain. It&#8217;s something similar to something
I want to do, and has many resources for visitors as well. </p>
</ol>
<li class="L3"><a href="http://www.daringfireball.net">Daring Fireball</a> <ol>
<p class="P4">I love the simplicity combined with elegance, content and standards
adhereance of this website by John Grubber. </p>
</ol>
<li class="L3"><a href="http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog">Get Rich Slowly</a> <ol>
<p class="P4">Blog by J.D. Roth who is learning about personal finance. I could
learn from the way the site is organised. </p>
</ol>
<li class="L3"><a href="http://registry.gimp.org">GIMP Plugin Registry</a> <ol>
<p class="P4">Gimp plugin registry. An inspiration for my website? </p>
</ol>
<li class="L3"><a href="http://www.der-winnie.de">Winnie&#8217;sSite</a> <ol>
<p class="P4">Beautiful site created with Ikiwiki. </p>
</ol>
<li class="L3"><a href="http://www.google.org">Google.org</a> <ol>
<p class="P4">Clean, simple, purposeful and usable focused yet beautiful. Gives
only as little information as asked. Another model website. </p>
</ol>
<li class="L3"><a href="http://www.noels-lab.com">Noel&#8217;s Lab</a> <ol>
<p class="P4">Website created entirely in a single otl file. The file was later
split by otlsplit and htmlized by olt2html.
</p>
<p class="P4">
I did not like the resulting html document as it has no heading
tags. Not good for search engine placement and general structure.
Also did not see the point of using numbered lists for all outlines
and css to modify the look to an unordered list or simple list.
</p>
<p class="P4">
However, looks good and reads well in a text browser.  Numbered
Lists add readability as they show where you are in the document.
Plus it might make sense that headings for outlines are not
necessary. Or I could just nest appropriate header tags under list
item tags. </p>
</ol>
<li class="L3"><a href="http://www.globalissues.org">Global Issues</a> <ol>
<p class="P4">I could learn from the organization of the site and the usage of
citations in the html as the separators of content. </p>
</ol>
<li class="L3"><a href="http://www.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</a> <ol>
<p class="P4">Exploring the structure and organization of the encyclopedia will be
valuable. I can learn from the disambiguation pages. </p>
