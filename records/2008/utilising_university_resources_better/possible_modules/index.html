work and conservation biology. While graduate students doing
their specific fields may be familiar with one method or
another, we believe it is important that they are also familiar
with techniques in other fields. This will not only strengthen
their knowledge base but also allow them to conduct
multidisciplinary research in the future. In addition, as these
students will graduate to lead research teams in the future,
they also be familiar with modern logistic planning, safety
preparation and due consideration of various legal issues and
constraints. For students not engaged in field work or who are
not working on biodiversity issues, this course will give them
excellent exposure to a key component of a different discipline. </p>

<p class="P4">This module explores the many forms of relationship between
politics and visual culture. From the ancient world to the
present, politics, whether formal or popular, has had a visual
dimension. Politicians have been concerned to control their
appearance; various media (from painting to theatre to
television to the internet) have been used to both serve and
defeat this goal. The module surveys the relationship between
politics and visual culture and allows students to engage with
contemporary issues surrounding politics, film, and digital
culture. </p>

<li class="L2">HY 3204 <ol>
<li class="L3">Southeast Asia: Decolonization & After <ol>
<p class="P4">That the Second World War impacted Southeast Asia is beyond
doubt. But the significance of its impact on the structure of
the region&#8217;s &#8217;contemporary&#8217; history is more debatable, for
revisionist historians are wont to discount the thesis that the
War represented a significant turning point or watershed which
&#8217;transformed&#8217; the region&#8217;s history. Drawing on both country and
regional perspectives, this module first assesses the impact of
the War on the theme of decolonization, perhaps the one major
historically significant process to dominate the region&#8217;s
political terrain in the immediate post-war aftermath. It will
further examine the challenges and trials confronting the new
states &#8220;after&#8221; decolonization, in particular, their search not
only for new political frameworks to replace the colonial
structures they had discarded, but also for solutions to
mitigate the issues of social integration, inter-state conflict
and regional co-operation. </p>
</ol>
</ol>
<li class="L2">HY 3225 <ol>
<li class="L3">Minorities in Southeast Asia <ol>
<p class="P4">With the creation of colonial states in Southeast Asia, certain
peoples in the region became minorities owing to their
languages, religious beliefs or customary practices. Examples
include the Shan and Karen in Myanmar, Muslim minorities in
Myanmar, Thailand and the Philippines, the people of the
Mountain Province in the Philippines, Christian communities in
Indonesia, the hill peoples of Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia,
and animist groups in Borneo and the Eastern archipelago.
Colonial administrations often made special provisions for these
minorities, but with independence the dominant ideology across
the region called for a single national identity within each
nation-state. This course examines the position of minorities
under colonial and post-colonial governments. It surveys the
minorities of the region, and develops case studies dealing with
selected groups. This course is designed for students throughout
NUS with an interest in history. </p>

<li class="L2">LL 4174 <ol>
<li class="L3">Beyond Law and Economics: Regulatory Theory <ol>
<p class="P4">This seminar will explore the emerging field of &#8217;regulatory
theory&#8217;. Regulatory theory adopts a economic approach to the
relationship between law and social regulation. But it is one
that differs significantly from that which informs &#8217;law and
economics&#8217;. Regulatory theory focuses more on macroeconomic
dynamics rather than microeconomic dynamics. It focuses more on
the role that markets play in social ordering, not just on their
economic functionalism. And it is more concerned with issues of
economic and regulatory evolution, not just those of economic
and regulatory efficiency. </p>

<li class="L3">Southeast Asia: A Changing Region <ol>
<p class="P4">Southeast Asia has been described as one of the &#8217;crossroads of
the world&#8217; - a place where people from many cultural, ethnic and
religious backgrounds meet. The intermingling of people, the
exchange of ideas and international commerce have been part of
Southeast Asian life for centuries. This module surveys the
broad currents of conflict, change and continuity across the
region from a multidisciplinary perspective. It looks at how
Southeast Asian societies and political systems have changed
over time in response to the pressures of ecology, colonialism,
nationalism, urbanization and globalization. The module also
looks at the way ethnic, religious, national and regional
identities have been constructed, used and altered over time.
The overall objective is to provide students with an
introduction to different ways of exploring Southeast Asia and
different experiences of living in the region. </p>

<li class="L3">Malays of Singapore <ol>
<p class="P4">A starting question for this module is “Who are the Malays of
Singapore?” Answering this question leads to further questions
with regards to their identity, their socio-economic status and
their concerns. Taking a socio-historical perspective this
module seeks to explore the different ways in answering these
questions. The module is divided into four topics of discussion:
Topic 1 looks at how Malays are perceived and portrayed. Topic 2
introduces students to approaches to studying the Malays of
Singapore. Topics 3 & 4 look at different dimensions of their
life in Singapore i.e. as Singapore citizens and as part of the
Malay &#8220;community&#8221;. Under these topics issues concerning Malay
ethnic identity, national integration and leadership will be
covered. The main theme of this module is portrayals of Malays
in Singapore i.e. how Singapore Malays are perceived and
presented with the aim of questioning these perceptions and
presentations. </p>

<li class="L3">Sustainable Urban Design and Development <ol>
<p class="P4">The module engages the contemporary issues of urban ecology
and its articulation to design and development in urban
settings. The new commitment of the co-habitation of nature and
built environment has drawn attentions of the architects, urban
designers and environmental professionals. The discourses of
urban sustainability have to move away from social sufficiency,
ecological efficiency to ecosystem compatibility by linking the
forms and flows of urban, industrial and natural systems. The
new challenges of urban ecological issue require design and
environmental professionals to deal with how urban and
environment spaces could be analyzed, designed, managed,
evaluated, represented and changed for responding to the
cutting-edge sustainable issues. Divided by two main categories,
Spatial Typologies and Ecological Flows, the series of lecture
covers the trends and issues of sustainable urban design and
development. Following the introductory lecture based on
planning and design history, the Part One Spatial Typologies
includes global ecological effects of mega urban form,
suburbanization and propositions of sustainable city, downtown
urban design, waterfront revitalization and brown field
redevelopment. The Part Two Ecological Flows covers the
ecological design issues of landscape ecological flow, material
and energy flow, water flow and informational flow. The sessions
conclude with the discussion of representational dimension of
urban and environmental design that is essential to the
professional practices of ecologically sound urban and
environmental design. By selecting one of the specific
sustainable urban issues, students are required to work on a
research project, which is to be presented as a team work during
the semester and further developed as an individual term paper
at the end of semester. </p>

<li class="L3">Complexity <ol>
<p class="P4">To enable the student in obtaining a global perspective of
diverse interesting complex systems in the biological, physical
and social sciences by introducing some of the common concepts
(e.g. emergent laws, entropy, dissipative structures, fractals),
principles (e.g. universality, criticality) and tools (e.g.
statistical mechanics, simple models and computer simulations)
used for their study. That is, the emphasis will be more on
studying and characterizing generic features of different
systems rather than a detailed study and solution of any
particular system. In this regard, the importance and value of
simple models, the robustness of the theoretical modeling data
and its comparison with controlled experiments will be
emphasized. However, it is equally important to distinguish
those modeling efforts and controlled experiments from the
fundamental underlying theory and data from natural systems. In
other words, one must be made aware of the difference between
qualitative and quantitative understanding, and between
plausible arguments and rigorous proof. </p>

<li class="L2">USE 2301 <ol>
<li class="L3">Economic Policy Analysis <ol>
<p class="P4">The objective of this module is to introduce students to the
idea of thinking economically through the process of learning
the basic economic principles and applying them to a spectrum of
economic questions and policy issues. We begin with the five key
principles of economic analysis, which are the principle of
opportunity cost, the marginal principle, the principle of
diminishing returns, the spillover principle and the reality
principle. The module will then examine some of the major
economic policy challenges of the twenty first century, drawing
primarily from the experience of Singapore in the global
economy. Some of the current economic concerns include ageing
and financing social security and health care, deregulation and
privatisation, free trade agreements, and economic
competitiveness. </p>

<li class="L3">Ethnomethodology: Semiotics of Everyday Life <ol>
<p class="P4">The Ethnomethodological school of Linguistic Anthropology
explores the fine-grained and non-obvious practices that
individuals use in order to make meaning and to communicate in
the momentary back-and-forth of real-time social interaction. In
addition to participating in the lectures and discussions of the
assigned readings, students in this module will gain hands-on
experience in the methods of data collection, transcription and
analysis used by ethnomethodologists, collecting their own
corpus of empirically collected data, which they will then
present to the class for in-depth analysis. </p>

<li class="L3">Expository Writing: Language Death <ol>
<p class="P4">What does it mean for a language to die? In this expository
writing module, we examine issues in language extinction: its
social, political, and economic causes, and the impacts that the
loss of language diversity will likely have on human society.
Students will read key texts in the field supplemented with
films and other materials, and will develop skills in
comprehensible and cohesive writing, critical reasoning,
rhetorical persuasion, and intellectually rigorous
argumentation. Students proceed through progressively more
challenging tasks, beginning with précis writing, to arguing a
policy position, and culminating in a research paper. </p>
</ol>
</ol>
<li class="L2">WP 2210A <ol>
<li class="L3">Analytical Writing: Language Death <ol>
<p class="P4">Languages of the world are disappearing at an alarming rate. Why
are languages dying, what impact does language death have on
human society, and what, if anything, should be done to prevent
it? In this analytical writing module, students will read a
broad range of texts addressing the issue of language death, and
will develop skills in synthesizing and thematically classifying
arguments and evidence from multiple sources. The module
emphasizes writing skills, the critical analysis of texts,
identifying arguments, classifying information, and applying
existing theoretical paradigms to primary sources. </p>

<li class="L3">Professional Communication <ol>
<p class="P4">The main aim of the course is to teach you how to become an
effective communicator in various social settings, but most
especially, in the workplace. By the end of the course, you
should be able to: - know and apply the principles of
communication to develop strategies for a successful exchange of
ideas with others in various social settings, but most
especially, within the workplace; - plan, construct and express
spoken and written messages clearly, convincingly and
professionally that are fitting to audience, context, and
purpose. Evaluation of this course is based on continual
assessment. There is no final examination. </p>

<li class="L3">Regulation and Regulatory Theory <ol>
<p class="P4">This seminar will explore the emerging field of &#8217;regulatory
theory&#8217;. Regulatory theory adopts a economic approach to the
relationship between law and social regulation. But it is one
that differs significantly from that which informs &#8217;law and
economics&#8217;. Regulatory theory focuses more on macroeconomic
dynamics rather than microeconomic dynamics. It focuses more on
the role that markets play in social ordering, not just on their
economic functionalism. And it is more concerned with issues of
economic and regulatory evolution, not just those of economic
and regulatory efficiency. </ol>
