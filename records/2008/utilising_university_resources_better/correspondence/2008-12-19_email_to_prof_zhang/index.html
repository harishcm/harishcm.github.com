<pre>Subject: Modules covering ``using local materials'' for building and construction

Dear Prof Zhang,

I am Harish from Yr 2 CVE. Over the past month, I got interested in learning more about using local materials for building and construction. Could be informed of what CE (or other fac) modules cover using local materials for construction?

I was told by Prof Somsak that you would be able to guide me as you have been working on recycled materials, green buildings, appropriate materials, etc.

Thank you for your help!

Regards,
Harish

Hi Harish

Thank you for sharing with us your thought.  I have also redirected your mail to Profs Ong, Wee and Zhang who have been working on recycled materials, green buildings, appropriate materials, etc. They should be able to guide you through this important topic of current interest.

Operation Orion has moved to Cambodia instead.  We got the solar panel from Grenzone and installed in a school of disabled.  The group is now there.  We will let you know any further development on the topic.

Best wishes and rgds

SSW

Dear Prof Somsak,

How are you doing? Hope your trip was fruitful and enjoyable.

During the past month, I have been reading this book, //Design like you
give a Damn//, edited by Architecture for Humanity. It was regarding
Architectural responses to humanitarian crises and development needs in
rural and marginalised areas.

It was especially interesting to read about using local materials, such
as adobe bricks, rammed earth, compressed earth, lime/cement
stabilization, bamboo structure, rebar roof truss etc. May I know if
there are any NUS CE modules that cover using local materials for
construction? Perhaps I should pose this question to my mentor as well?

Regarding our conversation about Grenzone, please keep me about related
activities. It would be great to visit Grenzone and possibly do an
attachment with Dr Toh.

Thanks and regards,
Harish
