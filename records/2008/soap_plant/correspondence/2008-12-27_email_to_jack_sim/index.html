<pre>Subject: Re: A simple proof of concept on soap plants

Hello Jack,

Thanks for pointing out how soap works :) I guess I confused myself 
in the email I sent. haha!

I was trying to mean that although the reduction in fecal coliforms 
was about the same for soap, ash and soil, it does not mean that all 
three are equally good at removing pathogens.

Like you say, soap can remove pathogens due to the way it works. But 
I'm not sure if ash and soil can do the same.

Maybe they work in another way and can remove fecal coliforms, but 
not the pathogens. We cannot tell from the two studies.

It would be better if we can get other types of evidence. Maybe say 
evidence that diarrhea rates among in families using soap are similar 
to diarrhea rates in families using ash or soil. Then we have a 
better case that ash and soil can actually remove pathogens. That's 
assuming of course other factors are kept constant. Also also 
assuming that diarrhea rates in families that use water only for 
handwashing is higher.

The main focus of my project is on `soap plants'. I was thinking of 
first coming up with a longer list of `soap plants'. Some of these 
plants would be those traditionally used for bathing, washing, etc. 
Others would be chosen due to their high concentrations of Saponins 
(soap like substances).

I should be able to finish a list, with pictures, growing conditions, 
distribution, etc. over the next two weeks. I think then we can have 
a better idea of what help we need from WASH people.

What do you think?

Regards,
Harish
