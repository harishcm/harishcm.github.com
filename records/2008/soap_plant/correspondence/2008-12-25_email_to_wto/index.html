<pre>Subject: Re: A simple proof of concept on soap plants

Hello Jack and Joey,

I have attached two journal articles describing experiments in 
which soap, ash and soil were used as handwashing agents.

All three, soap, ash and soil, greatly reduce the number of fecal 
coliforms on a person's hand after washing. Their effectiveness in 
reducing the number of fecal coliforms is about the same. Using 
water alone is ineffective in removing fecal coliforms.

Ash is gotten from burnt firewood. Soil can be scooped up from the 
ground. Both have to be rubbed between hands, just like soap, to be 
effective.

At first glance, I felt that this might mean that ash or soil is 
just as effective as soap for handwashing. However, I then realised 
that although the fecal coliforms were removed by handwashing, 
there is no information on the reduction in disease causing 
pathogens.

Fecal coliforms
---------------
The number of fecal coliforms per 100ml of water is widely used as 
an indicator of water quality. This is mainly because fecal 
coliforms can live outside our large intestines for a long time, 
and can be tested for relatively quickly and at low cost.

Testing for actual pathogens is time consuming, very expensive and 
seems to only give a yes/no result (no info on concentration).

However, fecal coliforms (E. coli is an example) are usually 
harmless to humans. Their presence in the environment indicates if 
and how much feces has mixed with water. We don't actually know
if the water consists of disease causing pathogens. 

Do see the reference below for more information about this.

Evaluation
----------
We know that soap, ash and soil are equally effective in removing 
fecal coliforms from hands.

However, we do not know the effectiveness of the above three 
handwashing agents in actually killing disease causing pathogens.

Possible next steps
-------------------

* Find research papers on effectiveness of soap, ash and soil in 
killing disease causing pathogens

* Find research papers on say diarrhoea rate versus usage of soap, 
ash, soil or water alone for handwashing

* Contact authors of the studies for clarification and raw data

Jack and Joey, what do you think?

Can you get in touch with people who would be in a better position 
to comment on the attached research papers?

Regards,
Harish
