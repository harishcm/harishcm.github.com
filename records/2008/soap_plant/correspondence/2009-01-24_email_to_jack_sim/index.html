<pre>Subject: Questions for WASH people

Dear Jack,

Below my signing off is a brief for questions for wash people. It concerns two related issues:

1. What makes an effective `hand soap'? 
2. What would allow the WASH community to accept a certain soap plant as an effective `hand soap'.

I feel that the main keyword would be `hand soap', as we have many examples of soap plants being used for body and garment cleansing but none for hand washing.

I apologise that I sent this to you very late. 

Happy Chinese New Year!

Regards,
Harish

Brief

One

In our research, we found that plants have been used directly for body/garment cleansing through the ages. However, we have not yet come across any record for plants being directly used for `hand washing'.

As such, what makes `hand soap' different from soap for the body or laundry detergent? What are the vital qualities it must have?

Two

It seems that it took several decades for soap usage to be recognised for it's immense role in improving sanitation. Evidence for its effectiveness had to come from many sources and from many different situations.

What tests/research/experience would allow the WASH community to accept a particular soap plant as an effective `hand soap'? Are there any `standards' that can act as a guide? You may assume that economic and botanical challenges can be overcome.
