<pre>Subject: ``Soap plants''

Dear Joey,

This is Harish, the one whom Jack introduced regarding 
research on ``soap plants''.

I am currently in my 2nd year in NUS, doing Civil Engineering. 
I got to find out about Jack Sim and the World Toilet Organisation in 2006
through a conference on social entrepreneurship held in NUS.
In July, I met Jack again at this Syinconnect conference, in which he
introduced this idea. I found it interesting and volunteered to help by
trying to find how such plants have been/can be used as ``soap''.

Information on soap and its mechanisms and making processes are plentiful.
Basically, soap molecules have portions that can dissolve oil and dirt
portions that can dissolve in water. Thus, they allow oil and dirt
to mix with water and be washed away easily. 
The raw materials in soap making are fatty acids 
(from vegetable oil/animal fat) and a mineral alkali (NaOH/KOH).

Regrarding ``soap plants'', I am currently trying to 
read up more about saponins. Saponins are chemicals from plants
that can dissolve in both water and oils. They form foams in water.
``Soaps'' also work in the same way. So in effect, saponin containing
plants could be used directly as ``soap alternatives''.

The web seems to have a lot of information about saponins,
though more interest seems to be about their 
possible usage as herbs and in medicines.

My current plan is to read up about saponins a bit more, 
especially from more scholarly sources such as conference proceedings. 
I could send you some references if you would be interested.

Next up would be to find where such plants are/have historically been located.
This may be the more challenging part. But, so far I know of one plant
database: Plants for a future (www.pfaf.org). 

You were telling me that you were working on a circular on sanitation.
I would be very pleased if you were to share with me some details about it,
and about other related projects that you are doing :)

I hope my email has been informational. Wish you a great week ahead!

Best regards,
Harish
