<pre>Subject: Report for further investigation (unfinished but 7 plants have been selected)

Attachments: report.pdf

Hello Jack and Joey,

I have attached a report on for further investigation. I apologise
that it is still largely unfinished. It has been very difficult to
get images that are `assured' to be the species of interest. I will
complete it over time, maybe even by taking the photos ourselves!

I think we can proceed from here by trying to get and experiment
with the 7 plants in the report. They are (in common names):

French Rose and Provence Rose
Asiatic pennywort / gotu kola / ji xue cao / vallarai
Japansese ginseng / zhu jie shen
zhi mu
Chinese licorice / gan zao
Air-potato / aerial yam / bitter yam / potato yam
Mung bean / green gram / golden gram

I already have the mung bean. I am trying to get the roses right
now. It should be possible to get the Asiatic pennywort from the
market as well, but will need really good identification. I am
banking on the local TCM shops to have Japanese ginseng, zhi mu and
Chinese licorice, but we must make sure we get the correct organs
of the plant. Only air-potato I am not sure, but it is widely
cultivated and I feel we should test it as it is widely cultivated
and fast growing.

Many of the above plants are mainly for testing purposes of the
whole concept. I think they are too slow to grow in mass as soap.
However, they are plants held in high esteem and will be good for
acceptance of the concept.

The Asiatic pennywort, air-potato and mung bean are possible plants
to be grown quickly and on a large scale. They are already plants
important in the food trade.

Lastly, we may be able to grow some of these plants in a local farm
(in the future). I got in touch with Mr Joseph Lai who is a
botanist helping to set up a local farm in Neo Tiew.

Do you think it will be possible to get plants organs from the TCM
shops? Will they be very expensive? Will there be discounts/excess
stock during/after Chinese New Year?

Do you know of any certified horticulturalist? My local florist
says better get help from an expert.

I think if we get 1 more plant (other than mung bean), we can start 
experimenting. What do you think? Btw, if you have found others 
interested in the idea, would be great to link up with them :)

Regards,
Harish

P. S. I'll send you questions for the WASH people in another email. 
Sorry, I'm leaving for school now. Basically, it would be good for us 
to find out what they think about using `non-soap' cleansing agents, 
will they support such a move? Also what they think about basing the 
search on `saponins', are all saponins useful as soap, can some cause 
harmful effects on skin, etc.
