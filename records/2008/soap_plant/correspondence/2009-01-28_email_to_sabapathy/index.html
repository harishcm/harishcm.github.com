<pre>Subject: Air-potato, Dioscorea bulbifera, for reserach into `soap plants' 

Attachment: proof_of_concept.pdf

Dear Mr Sabapathy,

I am Harish, an undergraduate in NUS, Civil Engineering. I am
currently doing some research into `soap plants' for the [World
Toilet Organisation][wto]. I happened to come across your blog
containing pictures and Tamil names of plant species found in
Singapore. It was very interesting to see the plants photographed
alongside familiar Singapore scenes :)

[wto]: http://www.worldtoilet.org

I have attached a preliminary report about the project. It gives a
short overview and a proof of the concept :) One of the `soap
plants' we are currently looking into is air-potato, Dioscorea
bulbifera. The tubers seem to contain large amounts (5.7%) of
Saponins. Ref: [Dr Duke's Ethnobotany Database][duke].

(Saponin is near the bottom of the page)

Saponins are natural
substances that lather when mixed in water and can probably work as
soap as their molecules have both hydrophilic and hydrophobic parts.
A related species seems to have been used as a body wash to kill lice.
Ref: [PFAF Database][pfaf].

(Scroll down to the section on `Other Uses')

I read that air-potato is an important food crop but was thinking
that it would be hard to find in SG until I came across your blog
and photos! We intend to test it out to see if/how it works you
see. We are not sure though if the tuber containing Saponin is the
underground one or the aerial one.

Do you think it will be wise for us to dig up one of the
underground tubers of the air-potato vine in Ang Mo Kio Ave 10? Or
better, do you know of local sources that we can get the air-potato
tubers from? I could even plant it in my HDB apartment till the
tuber is ready to be used for testing :)

Thanks for your help!
