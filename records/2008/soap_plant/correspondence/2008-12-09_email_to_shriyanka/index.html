<pre>Subject: Could you help me out with some research on ``soap plants''

Hi Shriyanka!

How are you doing? How are things back home? I did want to wish you before you left but I guess I sms-ed you a bit too late. haha!

I was wondering if you could help me out a little with some research that I am doing on ``soap plants''. I am doing this for the [World Toilet Organisation][wto]. The vision is to grow plants in urban and rural slums that can be used as direct soap substitutes. Somewhat like plucking a few leaves or a flower from a plant, rubbing your hands with it and rinsing away with water :)

[wto]: http://www.worldtoilet.org

Could you help me ask your family and friends, especially the older generations, regarding how plants in your/their culture have been used directly as soap substitutes? First hand knowledge will be excellent for the research!

As a lead, there are these medium height trees, genus Sapindus, commonly called Soapnut that are grown in India. The fruit can be rubbed in water to produce a lather that is an effective but gentle detergent. It is widely exported to Europe. I think it is grown in the temperate Himalayan regions. Indian cultures have used the fruit to wash their clothes by the riverside in the past, possibly today too. Though it might not be feasible to use it in new places, (it takes 6 years for the tree to mature, haha!), it's a very good example of what we are looking for :)

Thanks for your help and hope you are having a great time!

Regards,
Harish
