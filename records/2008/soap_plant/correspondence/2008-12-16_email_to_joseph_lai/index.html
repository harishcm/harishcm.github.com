<pre>Subject: Seeking your comments and resource recommendation about `soap plants'

Attachment: proof-of-concept.pdf

Dear Joseph,

I am Harish, and I participated in one of the
forest conservation walks led by you in Sentosa.
I am currently helping the [World Toilet Organisation][wto]
to come up with a list of plants that can be used as
direct soap substitutes. The inspiration was from Jack Sim, the founder.

[wto]: http://www.worldtoilet.org

Jack voiced out his idea of `soap plants' during a recent youth
conference on social change.
In his experience regarding sanitation issues, he found that
soap was not on the list of items `the poor'
would spend money on.
A handphone by contrast was high on the list.

He then suggested that a possible way to
ease in soap usage was to grow
`soap plants'---plants that could be directly used as soap substitues---
right next to the washing areas.
Excited by the idea, I volunteered to do research on such plants.

So far, I have found that a class of naturally occuring chemicals called
Saponins have the surfactant and lathering properties that is required of
soap when mixed in water. Following this lead, I found two ethnobotanical
databases that have been very useful, [Plants for a future][pfaf] and
[Dr. Duke's Phytochemical and Ethnobotanical Databases][duke].

[pfaf]: http://www.pfaf.org/database/search_use.php?K[]=Soap
[duke]: http://www.ars-grin.gov/duke/ethnobotuse.html

The above databases have given me a long list of plants that can be used
directly as soap substitutes.
PFAF, though focused on US and UK plants, has been very accessible.

I was wondering if you could give comments about this endeavour and
recommend sources of information regarding the following:

-- Description of plants being used as soap in East, South and Southeast Asia
-- Environmental problems that can occur if one were to grow such plants on a large scale
-- Source of bracken fern, Pteridium aquilinum, in Singapore.
It seems that is is distributed widely around the world and the 
rhizome lathers readily in water. [pfaf]
Brassica chinensis

I am currently studying in NUS, Civil Engineering. Thus, I have access to the
NUS library and possibly some of their botanical resources.
I have also attached a very preliminary proof of concept that I prepared for
the World Toilet Organisation. Please feel free to ask me anything about
this endeavour and please give your frank comments regarding it.
It will help us greatly!

Thanks and regards,
Harish
