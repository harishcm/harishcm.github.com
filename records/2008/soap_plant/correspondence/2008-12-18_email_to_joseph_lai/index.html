<pre>Subject: RE: Seeking your comments and resource recommendation about `soap plants'

Hi Joseph,

Thanks for the info and the links to pictures of the plants! Seems 
like oils from Jatropha curcas and Lecythis ollaria are used in the 
production of soap. Unfortunately we are not really looking that. 
Sorry I was not clear in my first email.

Actually, we am trying to look for plants that have organs that can 
be directly used as soap (substitutes). The initial (maybe naive) 
vision was for people to be able to pluck the leaves of a plant, rub 
it between wet hands, and rinse it off with water, just like using 
soap.

A good `real' example may be soap lily, Chlorogalum pomeridianum. The 
bulb (removed of its outer covering) was used by Native Americans in 
California as a direct soap substitute. It could even be dried and 
grated and used just like soap flakes. The [Plants for a Future 
database][pfaf] and this [webpage by Wayne's World][w-w] gives a 
detailed explanation of how the soap lily was used.

[pfaf]: http://www.pfaf.org/database/plants.php?Chlorogalum+pomeridianum
[w-w]: http://waynesword.palomar.edu/pldec198.htm

The so called active ingredient seems to be this group of naturally 
occurring chemicals called Saponins. I am now experimenting with Mung 
Bean, Vigna radiata, flour. The flour, when mixed with water to form 
a paste, has been used as a body wash in India. The [Dr Duke's 
database][duke] shows that it has between 500-6000 ppm of Saponins. I 
am not sure if this is `strong enough' to be used as a hand soap 
though.

[duke]: 
http://sun.ars-grin.gov:8080/npgspub/xsql/duke/plantdisp.xsql?taxon=1058 (may 
be necessary to use the `find' function to find SAPONINS as the list 
is very long)

I hope that I have given a better explanation of the research we are 
trying to do. Sorry that I was unclear initially. It would be great 
to hear your comments on this endeavour. And also recommend resources 
that are more localised to East, South and Southeast Asia. Those 
involved in the research have little background in botany, but we are 
trying to learn along the way and be respectful of the plants :)

Thanks and regards,
Harish
