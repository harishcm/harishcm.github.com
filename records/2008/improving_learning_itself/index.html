mindset changes that are needed for many women if
they wish to move into positions of authority.
</p>
<pre class="PRE4">- Getting comfortable with conflict, and learning how to resolve it.
- Separate tough business decisions from your self-judgement.
- As you achieve higher levels in your career, trade the female gold standard of over-delivering for relationship building, negotiating and influencing.
- Decide if you'd rather be liked or respected.
- Think about what YOU want.

- Thinking of how much I would `pay' for something new, versus how much I would `pay' for what I already have </pre>

Perhaps the bibliographies themselves will contain enough guidance.
And of course, being able to look at the data and information from a
blank perspective can have its perks.
