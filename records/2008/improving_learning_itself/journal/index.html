<li class="L2">Realisation <ol>
<p class="P3">I have not really explored methods of evaluation for different types
of learning projects. Should I bother with this? Is it even
important or just something that is done in formal education?
</p>
<li class="L3">Thoughts <ol>
<p class="P4">Evaluation is necessary when one has come up with work or has
completed a one stage of a project. It may be strongly linked
with fixed goals and aims. Is reflection the same as evaluation
for daily life and situations with moving targets and goals.
Still, one&#8217;s knowledge and learning skills can be evaluated,
though one needs to learn about the evaluative strategies
themselves.
</p>
<p class="P4">
But I do not have any significant purpose for evaluation. Unless
it is out of interest alone. Maybe I should read up a little on
how others manage this. </p>

<li class="L2">Idea <ol>
<p class="P3">Use machine speech software developed for blind persons for reading
websites and e-books.
</p>
<li class="L3">Inspiration <ol>
<p class="P4">Reading on computer screens is straining. I also realise that it
is considerably slower that reading from books. Technologies
like e-ink are available, but the machines they come with are
expensive, slow and crippled in what they can do.
</p>
<p class="P4">
Once, while exploring web usability and accessibility, I saw a
video of a blind person surfing the internet using a screen
reader. The speed of the audio he was listening to was
incredibly fast. He was likely to have been reading webpages
faster than sighted people.
</p>
<p class="P4">
This also represents a new means of interacting with computers
and a possible avenue for social entrepreneurship. </p>

<p class="P4">I want to check out bibliographies from various fields to get an
idea of where and how people in the field get their data and

</p>
<p class="P4">
But in order to utilise the information effectively, I may first
need to appreciate the underlying concepts.
</p>
<p class="P4">
Perhaps the bibliographies themselves will contain enough guidance.
And of course, being able to look at the data and information from a
blank perspective can have its perks.

<p class="P4">Extrinsic motivation significantly improves performance for
deterministic problems with clear goals and rulesets.
However, it significantly <em>decreases</em> performance for undeterministic
problems with undefined goals and rulesets.
</p>
<p class="P4">
In an experiment testing performace under an undeterministic
problem, low and medium rewards achieved similar
performance while high rewards significantly degraded
performance.
</p>
<p class="P4">
<em>Autonomy</em>, <em>mastery</em> and <em>purpose</em> were introduced as factors
improving performance in problems requiring creativity and
undeterministic problem solving. </p>

rapid learning. </p>
