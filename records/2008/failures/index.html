<div class="MainPage">
<ol>
<li class="L1">2010-05-13 <ol>
<li class="L2">Created Outline <ol>
<p class="P3">Realised that I already had several resources relevant to failure
and that it would be good to record down my inspirations for getting
interested in failures. </p>
</ol>
</ol>
<li class="L1">2010-01-09 <ol>
<li class="L2">Flashing my water damaged phone from a Windows XP virtual machine <ol>
<p class="P3">My phone can connect through the usb port and get picked up in the
virtual machine OS as well. However, only the SEMC Flash is detected
and it only stays connected for a minute or less. Even the detection
requires several attempts at plugging the usb connectors in and out
before it gets detected.
</p>
<p class="P3">
This may be a usb port power problem. The phone may need more
power than usual because some of the circuits have become fried. Or
maybe the hardware is too spoilt and I am on a hopeless adventure.
Then perhaps it is time to attempt desoldering the flash chip and
put it into a flash reader&#8230; </p>
</ol>
</ol>
<li class="L1">2010-01-02 <ol>
<li class="L2">Flashing my water damaged phone from a Windows XP virtual machine <ol>
<p class="P3">This was pretty crazy. First, I started to read up about what
flashing actually was and what tools there are out there.
That took me almost an entire day. All the flashing software that
I came across only worked on Windows, so I decided to install
Windows through virtualization.
</p>
<p class="P3">
For that I had to first create an iso image of the rescue dvd that
came with my netbook. Finding out how to do that took a long time.
In the end it was just a simple command using <code>dd</code>.
</p>
<p class="P3">
Though that was settled, the rescue installer would not install on the
virtual machine&#8217;s hard drive, and I had to modify the iso image to
resemble a stock Windows XP disk and installer. After much trial and
error, I finally realised that I could directly use one of the I386
folders in the image, while adding the files WIN51, WIN51C,
WIN51C.SP1, WIN51C.SP2 and WIN51C.SP3, and getting a suitable boot
image from the internet.
</p>
<p class="P3">
After installation in the virtual machine I got internet
running on the virtual machine and downloaded the phone software
updater from Sony Ericsson. Only then did I realise that I could
not directly connect my damaged phone through usb to the virtual
machine in an usual fashion.
</p>
<p class="P3">
By then I was too tired to go further. 3 days of trying to solve
the problem was a bit too much.
</p>
<p class="P3">
On a brighter note, I got a feel of virtualization.
And I am glad for that. I am likely to use virtualization pretty often
from now on. Using more than one OS at the same time felt
really good. </p>
</ol>
</ol>
<li class="L1">2009-09-25 <ol>
<li class="L2">Setting up Ubuntu 9.04 &#8220;from scratch&#8221; <ol>
<p class="P3">It was exciting when I started. But I realised that I wanted much
much more than just the base install system. Eventually, I gave up
and installed the default ubuntu-desktop from the install cd.
Well, I got to learn a little about the install tree though :) </p>
</ol>
</ol>
<li class="L1">2009-07-16 <ol>
<li class="L2">Enabling folding with key strokes for outlines on website <ol>
<p class="P3">I tried for 2&#8211;3 hours to implement a simple proof of concept
for folding of outlines with the keystrokes &#8216;\1&#8217;, &#8216;\2&#8217; and so
on. In the end it could not work and I did not know how to debug
it either.
</p>
<p class="P3">
The main problem is that I am not even sure if such an concept
can be implemented in javascript for webpages. haha!
Maybe one way would be to get sample code from a javascript
cookbook and implement it. </p>
</ol>
</ol>
<li class="L1">2008-10-22 <ol>
<li class="L2">Patching the A-bicycle tire puncture <ol>
<p class="P3">Itended to spend a couple of hours in the morning to
patch up the inner tube of my A-bicycle that I had
damaged by pumping in too much air
or had spoilt due to wear and tear/inferior quality.
</p>
<p class="P3">
Then realised that I could not turn most of the
hexagonal socket screws found in the bicycle as
I did not the hex keys of the correct size.
Mine were slightly too big or slightly too small and were also
not slightly tapered as the hexagonal sockets appeared to be.
</p>
<p class="P3">
I also realised, again as I had removed the rear wheel
once before also in attempting to replace the inner tube,
that I could not unscrew the rear break holder.
I had to instead unscrew the break wire to give space
to remove the wheel.
</p>
<p class="P3">
After several hours, I managed to remove the rear wheel,
remove the inner tube, find the punctures,
patch them and reassemble everything.
I even found that the rear wheel could
be pumped to a higher pressure, which meant a smoother ride,
when the tire was raised slightly
where the air valve was located.
</p>
<p class="P3">
I then tried out the bike within my house.
After a few rounds, I heard this familiar &#8220;pisst&#8221; sound,
the same one that I heard when the tire
initially got punctured.
</p>
<p class="P3">
A new problem with a lock spring getting stuck to the chain,
preventing the bike from being opened also appeared and
is still unsolved, though the problem area has been identified.
</p>
<p class="P3">
I did not find the persistence to continue on that day.
I had also planned to use the remaining of the day
to prepare for a school test the next day.
</p>
<p class="P3">
My reactions were mixed, considering on one hand that I had
spent several hours trying to fix it, and on the other, that
it was a lesson in failure, that just because I had worked hard,
I was not entitled to &#8220;success&#8221;.
But I got to see how things could be slowed down greatly
when the required tools were unavailable and got valuable
experience in fixing a puncture/changing an inner tube. </p>
</ol>
</ol>
<li class="L1">2008-04-24 <ol>
<li class="L2">Didn&#8217;t Go For Planned Excursion <ol>
<p class="P3">I had planned an excursion with my mum to the Organic Farms in
Kranji Countryside and Neo Tiew Road. However, my mum could not
make it and it was raining in the morning. I had also woken up
later than what I wanted&#8212;9am instead of 7am. I decided to not
go today. My mum says that she will be available next wedensday.
</p>
<p class="P3">
I realised that I did not plan for wet weather and that I have
been staying up late. I want to wake up early at 7am on a
regular basis so that I can do morning activities like jogging
and exercise. But it was good that I had roughly planned the
excursion. Maybe I&#8217;ll email the farmers to inform them that I
want to come down next Wednesday. </p>
</ol>
</ol>
<li class="L1">2008-04-20 <ol>
<li class="L2">Apache DAV Setup <ol>
<p class="P3">Tried to set up Apache WebDAV so that I get a friend to upload
files to my computer without problems with his firewall. I
followed a short set up process but when I accessed the WebDAV
URL, it showed Forbidden. I assumed that there was something
wrong with the set-up I just did and tried randomly changing
stuff to see if it would work. Nothing did.
</p>
<p class="P3">
Eventually I found that URLs to all my other folders that did
not have an index.html file in them gave the same error. The
Forbidden code was to do with me main Apache server setup! Darn.
And I had rolled back all the changes I had made to set up
WebDAV.
</p>
<p class="P3">
I guess it is a lesson to learn more about what I am setting up
instead of blindly following instructions. </p>
</ol>
</ol>
<li class="L1">2008-04-21 <ol>
<li class="L2">Software Freedom Day Message Board Reply <ol>
<p class="P3">Crafted a reply half-way to the post by kit-sg. I think I spent
about 2 hours on it. Is this a problem? Granted, it is well
thought out. A lot of ideas at first, then writing them down and
finally cutting down the post in size. Is this sustainable? Or
is this the only way to achieve a well-written post? I will
finish it soon. </p>
</ol>
</ol>
<li class="L1">2008-04-19 <ol>
<li class="L2">Forgot and Missed Linux Meetup on 16th April <ol>
<p class="P3">Gosh! I completely forgot about attending the Linux Meetup that
I was rearing to go for! I guess that directing all the mailing
lists that I want to read to another email account might not be
a good idea in this respect.
</p>
<p class="P3">
I guess, for things that I am actively pursuing, the messages
should come to my primary email address, which I check more
often. </p>
</ol>
</ol>
<li class="L1">2008-04-18 <ol>
<li class="L2">FTP Server Setup <ol>
<p class="P3">Tried for some time to set up vsftpd, gave up and tried proftpd,
gave up again, and then tried vsftpd again. I checked out blog
and forum posts for advice along the way. Finally was able to
connect to the server through localhost.
</p>
<p class="P3">
However, I still cannot connect to the server through the
internet ip address. I suspect the problem lies with the
firewall running on the router. I&#8217;ll momentarily turn off the
router firewall and check if I can connect. </p>
</ol>
</ol>
<li class="L1">2008-04-17 <ol>
<li class="L2">Farmwars Discussion <ol>
<p class="P3">Couldn&#8217;t contribute intelligently to farmwars discusstion on the
user interface breaking in Internet Explorer. Spent quite a lot
of time trying to. But learnt a little about Document Type
Definitions (DTDs). </p>
</ol>
<li class="L2">Journal and Ideas Organisation <ol>
<p class="P3">Still cannot settle on the file system organization that I want.
It is difficult to settle on a balance between over-flattening
and over-nesting of the trees.
</p>
<p class="P3">
The solution may be to keep playing around for a few days. Once
I decide, moving the files around will not be a problem. </ol>
</ol>
