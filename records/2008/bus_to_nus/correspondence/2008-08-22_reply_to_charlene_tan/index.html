<pre>Hello Charlene,

I checked out the video. I feel that it's well made and gives a good feel of 
the journey! Thanks too, for sharing your experiences and information. It was 
good to know a little more about the current state of Velocebus.

Although many in the team are busy, I feel that you guys can improve on your 
website. It is the primary information centre for the NUS community and other 
partners regarding Velocebus. I feel that a few changes in the website can give
 a better sense of continuity for the project. Right now it looks outdated and 
possibly even abandoned.

A few changes I suggest:
* Change as little as possible (reuse sections)
* Remove time-specific information. It gives a feeling of outdated-ness.
* Remove non-current information such as "promotions"
* Include your achievements
** Link to the video (It's very good!)
** Achievements can be the support from the NUS Admin, details/experiences of 
the trial period, etc.
* Include your challenges and ask for people who can contribute
** A "We are looking for ..." or a "Join Us" or "Partner Us" section
** Ask for suggestions/contributions regarding the booking system, bus fare 
payment, etc.
* Reuse the "Suggest route" form as a general contact form. (Invites less spam)
** Remove the &lt;service@velocebus.com&gt; that is not manned (and I suspect gets 
spammed).
** May allow you to be more confident in directing submissions to an often read
email address.

The main idea is to give an impression of continuity of the project. If you 
guys would be interested, I could share specific suggestions on improving the 
website. I could even pass you guys a modified copy of your website to ease the
editing. Maybe some inputs from me could help to cheer you guys along in the 
project.

Tell me what think about it :)

Regards,
Harish
