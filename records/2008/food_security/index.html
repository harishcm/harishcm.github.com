<h1 id="food_security">Food Security</h1>
</div>
<div class="MainPage">
<ol>
<li class="L1">Inspiration <ol>
<p class="P2">I am greatly concerned that food security around the world is declining
rapidly. Was first alerted to this problem by World Hunger 12 Myths. I
have subsequently read numerous articles about massive food recalls and
less than adequate / lenient enforcement actions.
</p>
<p class="P2">
I also doubt the effectiveness of food safety certification testing. It
appears to me to be a slow and tedious process that cannot keep up with
the shear volumes and speed of food shipments. As usual there is a lot
more that I should know about. </p>
</ol>
<li class="L1">Keywords <ol>
<li class="L2">Abatoirs </ol>
<li class="L1">Food Security Issues <ol>
<li class="L2">Businesses conglomerates with conflicting interests <ol>
<p class="P3">Increasingly, large agriculture companies are coming under the same
family of companies as fertilizer companies and pharmacetical and
vitamin pill companies. </p>
</ol>
<li class="L2">Mass Industrial Agriculture <ol>
<li class="L3">Terrible living conditions lead to sick animals <ol>
<li class="L4">Cramped Conditions
<li class="L4">Living among Dead Animals
<li class="L4">Living among Excreta
<li class="L4">Results in Sickness </ol>
<li class="L3">Overuse of Drugs <ol>
<p class="P4">Since living conditions are terrible, without drugs the death
rate of industrially reared animals will be extremely high. So,
drugs are extensively used.
</p>
<li class="L4">Antibiotics <ol>
<p class="P5">Mixed with animal feed </p>
</ol>
<li class="L4">Growth Supplements <ol>
<p class="P5">Broiler chickens reach full size in 45 days. Mentally they
are still chicks and they are not fully developed physically
either. Their legs for one are not developed and many break
their legs due to their extreme size and weight. </p>
</ol>
</ol>
<li class="L3">Other Issues <ol>
<li class="L4">Torture experienced by animals being reared <ol>
<li class="L5">Genetic Dieseases
<li class="L5">Physical Pain and Fractures
<li class="L5">Rough Handling </ol>
</ol>
</ol>
<li class="L2">Genetically Engineered Crops and Animals <ol>
<li class="L3">Rationale for creation and production <ol>
<li class="L4">Created mainly because they are patentable <ol>
<p class="P5">Other plants and lifestock are not patentable as they derive
from methods of breeding that have been around for hundreds
of years. </p>
</ol>
</ol>
<li class="L3">Dangerous potential for curtailing biodiversity <ol>
<li class="L4">Culture of sharing, improving and preserving biodiversity <ol>
<p class="P5">It has been the culture and accumulated knowledge of farmers
and animal rearers to grow a variety of species and strains
of plants, share their knowledge and plant species with one
another and preserve species with a large variety of
resistance properties (eg. drought, specific diseases).
</p>
<p class="P5">
This has long created a win-win situation for all farmers
both in terms of being able to breed better species and
reduce the chance of complete wipeout of their produce in
times of disease or natural disaster. </p>
</ol>
<li class="L4">Incompatibility of such culture to monopolistic business plans <ol>
<p class="P5">The push for greater market share and monopolistic
tendencies inhenerent in businesses such as patent
proliferation will strongly discourage the sharing that has
been present and beneficial for all so far. </p>
</ol>
</ol>
<li class="L3">No way to measure risks involved <ol>
<li class="L4">It is unknown what possible future risks are <ol>
<p class="P5">There is no means for debate or calculation about risks as
we do not even know what risks are present. </p>
</ol>
<li class="L4">Reluctance of Insurance companies to insure GMOs <ol>
<p class="P5">Insurance companies are unwilling to insure against long
term harm caused by genetically modified organisms and
products.
</p>
<li class="L5">Reason <ol>
<li class="L6">Cannot assign risk </ol>
</ol>
</ol>
<li class="L3">Contamination of non-GM sources through cross pollination
<li class="L3">Genetic modification is usually unsuccessful <ol>
<p class="P4">Most genetically modified organisms are physically and mentally
disabled or have gentic diseases. Many of them also suffer from
diseases arising from old age even when they are young. </p>
</ol>
</ol>
<li class="L2">Ineffectiveness of Safety Nets <ol>
<li class="L3">Random food checks <ol>
<p class="P4">Only a very small percentage of food is checked for the presence
of harmful substances. The overwhelming majority of food is
passed unchecked. </p>
</ol>
</ol>
</ol>
<li class="L1">First Resolution <ol>
<li class="L2">Move down the Food Chain <ol>
<li class="L3">Inspiration <ol>
<li class="L4">The DDT story <ol>
<p class="P5">Levels of DDT were found to be more concentrated in animals
higher up the food chain.
</p>
<p class="P5">
Harmful chemicals can accumulate in the bodies of plants and
animals over periods of time. When these plants and animals
are eaten, the harmful chemicals get transfered to predator
that ate them.
</p>
<p class="P5">
Since a predator eats much more than its own body weight over
its lifetime, the harmful chemicals tend to bio-accumulate
inside the predator&#8217;s body.
</p>
<p class="P5">
This leads to higher concentrations of harmful chemicals as
one looks higher up the food chain. </p>
