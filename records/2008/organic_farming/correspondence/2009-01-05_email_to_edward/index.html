<pre>Re: FOOD FOR ALL 2008 REPORT - CRITICAL FOOD ISSUES IN SINGAPORE

Hi Edward!

Sorry that I am replying you after soo long. I missed your email and even told Heather that I didn't think I received it. Wow, bad me ):

Yup, I am very keen in doing an internship/apprenticeship at a local organic farm. The time period would be anytime during the summer vacation---from the 2nd week of May to last week of July. Officially, I am thinking of a 1 month experience, possibly extendable to 2 months. I would really like to see the plants grow :)

I would say that my main motive is to get some basic experience in farming and especially organic farming. 

Second would be to learn about some issues &amp; challenges facing Singapore's organic farmers and the community.

I would love to be more specific but really, I fear that my mental images of farming are greatly distorted. But rest assured that I am agreeable with both physical and mental work and work that requires skills/knowledge to be learnt before hand. As preparation I could begin reading a book (that you would recommend) on organic farming. I could also come down to the farm during term time once in a while to get myself prepared for the experience. I guess I could be more specific then :)

Yeah, I am aware that most of the organic farms are located in the Neo Tiew/Lim Chu Kang area. Unfortunately I live in Pasir Ris. But no pain no gain I guess. ;)

I have included more information about myself below.

Thanks and regards,
Harish

More about myself
-----------------

Full name: Mohanadas Harish Chandar
Current vocation: Student in NUS Civil Engineering Yr 2
Age: 23

What made me interested in this internship/apprenticeship
---------------------------------------------------------

I have been interested in food issues for about 2 years or so now.
It started off when I picked up this book, World Hunger: 12 Myths
by Frances Moore Lappe and Joe Collins. It made me realised that
World Hunger is an extremely interconnected complex topic, with 
links from ``modes of production'' to international trade to
international finance to local social/economic/climate conditions 
and cultures.

I then went on to read a little about monocropping, pesticide usage
and some of its long term effects, humanity's culture of seed banking 
and sharing, etc. I have also read a little and seen videos about 
industrial agriculture, along with it's inherent cruelty, huge energy 
and water usages and huge subsidies (in the US and the EU). Recently,
I watched this documentary about genetically engineered crops--- 
The World According to Monsanto by Marie-Monique Robin. 

I guess much of my readings have been heavily biased towards viewpoints
that highlight the problems with food and agriculture around the world.
Only a small part of what I read was about projects to solve these issues,
and about viewpoints from those in favour of the status quo. 
Also much of my readings have been US-centric.

Learning about and having some experience in organic farming right
at home in Singapore are a natural extension to learning pursuits 
regarding food and agriculture :)

Other related interests
-----------------------

I am greatly interested in getting a feel of the 
``data and statistics'' regarding food and other issues. I am 
currently learning a little about data visualisation---representing 
data in visual and software forms so as to make it more accessible 
to people and to be able to see it from different perspectives.

I am also doing some research into `soap plants' for the 
World Toilet Organisation. These are plants that can or have been 
used as direct soap substitutes. It is mainly to benefit rural/urban
poor who do not buy soap. If `soap plants' can be grown next to their
washing areas, it would be a bonus to sanitation efforts around the
world. I have done a short proof of concept so far. Do ask me for it 
if it interests you :)
