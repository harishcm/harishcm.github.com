<li class="L3">FOSS in non-profit organizations <ol>
<li class="L4">BY Jeff Jansen
<li class="L4">AT Software Freedom Day Singapore 2008
<li class="L4">Felt <ol>
<p class="P5">What a surprise! Just the day before, I had been trying to
find ways of typesetting Tamil using TeX and
find programs to create and edit fonts! It was such a
coincidence to attend a talk from a person working for an
organisation that is involved in minority linguistics.
</p>
<p class="P5">
I came back with great resources to effort on including
Unicode support and smart font rendering for even
minority languages, including South Asian scripts.
</p>
<p class="P5">
It was also a great resource on Open Source
in non-profit organisation in general. Wow! </p>
</ol>
</ol>

</ol>
<li class="L1">2008-09-10 <ol>
<li class="L2">Achievement <ol>
<li class="L3">Typeset a lab report within 1.5 days <ol>
<p class="P4">Experience and example tex sources from the prior report
done during the UROP project allowed me to have a
base to start off from.
</p>
<p class="P4">
Challenges were typesetting the numerous equations and
fitting a (horizontally) wide table into a page.
I eventually put that set that page in landscape using the
&#8220;lscape&#8221; package and increased the borders by using the
&#8220;fullpage&#8221; package.
</p>
<li class="L4">Evaluation <ol>
<p class="P5">The charts and most of the general typesetting was good.
There was a page of short equations that seemed to have
extremely large left and right margins. Placing a whole page
of short equations in two column format may make it better. </p>
</ol>
<li class="L4">Evaluation <ol>
<li class="L5">2008-09-22 <ol>
<p class="P6">I still do not have much experience with more
advanced math typesetting. There are still a
lot more commands (though simple and
self-evident in many cases)
to be learnt. </p>
</ol>

<li class="L4">Expectation <ol>
<li class="L5">Completion time <ol>
<li class="L6">One week at the most </ol>
</ol>
<li class="L4">Experience <ol>
<p class="P5">Was taken aback when I saw that one chapter was 20 pages.
There were five chapters in total.
</p>
<p class="P5">
Another large problem was the references. I had to
replace each hand done reference number superscript
with &#8220;cite&#8221; commands.
</p>
<p class="P5">
However, I was lucky to get a copy of Zhoubin&#8217;s thesis,
which was typeset in LateX. I can learn from his
implementation example! </p>
</ol>
<li class="L4">Reflections <ol>
<li class="L5">2008-09-22 <ol>
<p class="P6">I could have automated the replacing of reference
superscripts with &#8220;cite&#8221; commands.
</p>
<p class="P6">
It was the fact that the thesis was
almost completed that made me unwilling to commit
to converting it. </p>

<p class="P5">I spent a long time to learn about various
packages to fulfuil elements that
I wanted in my report. Much of it was
trial, error, finding better method, trial again.
</p>
<p class="P5">
The whole experience took a much longer time
than I had expected. Much time was spent in the lab,
longer than what I would have wanted
Much time was also spent on just
accessing the journal from the closed databases, to
retrieve individual articles. </p>
