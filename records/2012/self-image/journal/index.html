<li class="L3">The Dark Side of Power Posing: Cape or Kryptonite? <ol>
<li class="L4">BY Jay Van Bavel
<li class="L4">Article, 2013
<li class="L4">IN Scientific American MIND Guest Blog
<li class="L4"><a href="http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/mind-guest-blog/2013/11/21/the-dark-side-of-power-posing-cape-or-kryptonite/">URL</a>
<li class="L4">Initial Perception <ol>
<p class="P5">The article cites academic papers related to power posing
and its effects on one&#8217;s personal psychology. The article
argues that power posing may not be a cure-all, and it may
have a dark side in that it may reinforce negative
self-thoughts leading to lower self-confidence, especially
in people who are downtrodden. The article noted that while
power posing may help, say, students in elite institutions,
on whom the initial research was performed, it may possibly
have an opposite effect on many other people.
</p>
<p class="P5">
The article also highlighted that the situational context
under which the power poses are enacted may be more
important than the power pose itself.
</p>
<p class="P5">
It would be interesting to explore the papers cited in the
article. </p>

<li class="L4">BY Amy Cuddy
<li class="L4">Talk, 2012
<li class="L4">AT TEDGlobal 2012, Edinburgh, Scotland
<li class="L4"><a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/amy_cuddy_your_body_language_shapes_who_you_are.html">URL</a>
<li class="L4">Initial Perception <ol>
<p class="P5">Amy Cuddy talks about how power posing for just two minutes
can get individuals to become more confident and more
assertive and achieve lower stress levels with immediate
effects. This is very similar to the
Actions-Beliefs-Feelings triangle of the <a href="../../../2009/stuttering/life_skills_handout/">Life Skills
Handout</a>.
The Life Skills Handout postulates that one&#8217;s actions,
beliefs and feelings have direct, bidirectional impacts on
one another. </p>

<li class="L2">Reflection <ol>
<p class="P3">I recently read a couple of articles by Lauren Rivera on how
employers in &#8220;elite&#8221; professional service industries (defined as law, investment banking
and management consulting) choose their future employees. They were
</p>
<p class="P3">
• &#8220;Ivies, Extracurriculars, and Exclusion: Elite employers&#8217; use of
educational credentials&#8221;, in
<i>Research in Social Stratification and Mobility</i>, Volume 29, Pages
71&#8211;90, and
</p>
<p class="P3">
• &#8220;Hiring as Cultural Matching: The case of elite professional service
firms&#8221;, in <i>American Sociological Review</i>, Volume 77, Issue 6, Pages
999&#8211;1022.
</p>
<p class="P3">
In her articles, Lauren Rivera showed evidence that these firms
</p>
<p class="P3">
• confined the overwhelming majority of recruiting and recruiting
efforts to a very small list of universities while neglecting many
other equally or more highly-selective universities,
</p>
<p class="P3">
• used participation in resource-intensive extracurricular
activities&#8212;that often required significant parental
investment&#8212;to further narrow the applicant pools, e.g. favouring
scaling Kilimanjaro over recreational hiking, or favouring
pay-to-play &#8220;club&#8221; sports such as tennis or crew over more
accessible sports such as football or basketball, or penalising
applicants who had to engage in paid work or caregiving in
dimensions such as &#8220;interestingness&#8221;, &#8220;sociability&#8221; and
&#8220;well-roundedness&#8221;, and
</p>
<p class="P3">
• used judgements or perceptions of &#8220;cultural fit&#8221; from
leisure profiles as a formal criteria in assessing applicants, often
ranking it as being more important than performance during
case-interviews or having relevant experience.
</p>
<p class="P3">
Lauren Rivera argued that the above hiring practices resulted in a
&#8220;social closure&#8221; of graduate employment in these &#8220;elite&#8221; firms to
applicants from at least an upper-middle-class background, and that
the hiring process could be likened to process of finding
friends or romantic partners, where similarity between persons was a
strong draw factor, rather than a process in which the most capable
applicants were sought after.
</p>
<p class="P3">
Reading these articles was somehow particularly soothing, and
made me feel much better about myself. Perhaps it was due to
hearing a alternative scholarly voice against the onslaught of
commentary in recent years equating renumeration with skill,
talent and intelligence, and asserting that only the &#8220;best&#8221; and
&#8220;brightest&#8221; joined these &#8220;elite&#8221; professional service
industries&#8212;probably in a circular argument to justify their
extraordinary renumeration and give credence to their &#8220;advice&#8221; and
statements (e.g. &#8220;too big to fail&#8221;).
</p>
<p class="P3">
But of course, feeling better about myself does not mean that I
become satisfied with my achievements so far, or with the status quo
of the things around me.
</p>
<p class="P3">
Instead, it leaves open questions as to where and how do I move
on from here, to better myself, and more importantly, in what,
and why so? </p>
