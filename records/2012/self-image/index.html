<li class="L1">Initial Inspiration <ol>
<p class="P2">It has been a long journey, along which I have dealt with several
self-image issues.
</p>
<p class="P2">
I am a stutterer, and it affects my self image, but
the entire package is much, much larger than stuttering itself. A part
of it is cultural, or rather feelings linked to cultural acceptance and
an illusion of cultural superiority-inferiority.
</p>
<p class="P2">
Self-image played a large part in me setting up this website in the
first place, and in wanting to find a solution to my grievances against
the formal education system I was in when I was younger.
</p>
<p class="P2">
I dare to bring this up, now, as I now have more than a glimpse of
Research&#8212;often touted to be the
&#8220;highest calling of the academically trained mind&#8221;&#8212;which I had the
opportunity to get into, largely due to learning skills I picked up
along the way while being engaged in self-directed learning, and in
part, due to my supervisor being impressed by this website itself.
</p>
<p class="P2">
I am no longer afraid of being put down as less intelligent, or out of my
league, as a I have seen and read about happenings in this &#8220;highest
calling&#8221;, and have first hand experience that both hard work
and passion are necessary in coming up with bold, cutting-edge ideas.
</p>
<p class="P2">
I also recently recently made a career change, in a large part, to
address my self-image. I think that this learning project will be a lot
more intertwined with my life and personal circumstances&#8212;maybe
somewhat more towards the spirit of self-directed learning in itself.
</p>
<p class="P2">
I have had a lot of self-image issues in the past, but it is only now
that I feel motivated and courageous enough to collate and share
resources and experiences in the online world. </p>
