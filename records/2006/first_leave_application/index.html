<li class="L2">The Gist
<li class="L2">Background <ol>
<p class="P3">I have been toying with the idea of self-directed learning for
several months now. </p>
</ol>
<li class="L2">Self-directed learning definition <ol>
<p class="P3">I became very interested in its possibilities. Self-directed learning
to me meant full control over initiating and managing my own
learning projects. </p>
</ol>
<li class="L2">Time <ol>
<li class="L3">Central part of life </ol>
<li class="L2">I have been primarily focused on two areas <ol>
<li class="L3">Can I actually self-direct my learning?
<li class="L3">Is it possible to make self-directed learning a central part of my adult life? </ol>
<li class="L2">Results <ol>
<p class="P3">The results have been positive so far. Deciding how &#8216;much&#8217; and how
&#8216;deep&#8217; I would learn, in addition to setting my own objectives and
schedules, made me feel empowered.
</p>
<p class="P3">
It seems to me that self-directed learning comes naturally when
given the time and freedom.
</p>
<p class="P3">
When I started, there was an extended period of
</p>
<p class="P3">
Thus far however, my scope on collaborative projects still involves
only people of my own age group. I have started to address this by
joining Unschoolers&#8217; and Homeschoolers&#8217; Support Groups and intend to
do a couple of projects with former teachers.
</p>
<p class="P3">
Though the results are positive,  make this a central part of adult
life. To do this I feel the need to build support structures and
networks required for such an initiative. </p>
</ol>
<li class="L2">Safety Net <ol>
<p class="P3">Since I intend to make learning a central part of my life, I might
not be making much money. Responding to concerns about my financial
security, I intend to first focus on building &#8216;safety nets&#8217;.
</p>
<p class="P3">
I will be starting off by investigating the possibility of skills
being tapped to provide income as and when necessary. I will be
looking into life skills, physical skills and specialist skills
first. As my exploration continues, I expect myself to modify the
skills I will be looking into and be open to other possibilities. </p>
</ol>
<li class="L2">Ambition Explained
<li class="L2">Inspiration
<li class="L2">Other Resources
<li class="L2">Conclusion <ol>
<p class="P3">I intend to take the next semester off so that I can have the time
and &#8216;space&#8217; needed for this effort. This experiment in
self-directed learning has become very important to me. Even at this
early stage, it has already been life-changing. </p>
</ol>
</ol>
<li class="L1">Elaboration <ol>
<li class="L2">Background <ol>
<p class="P3">I have been experimenting with an idea of self-directed learning for
several months now.
</p>
<p class="P3">
I took self-directed learning to mean learning in which the
individual has complete control and responsibility over what he is
learning. The individual is also fully responsible for finding his
own resources and mentors. This implies that he is free to decide
the relative emphasis placed on formal and informal learning.
</p>
<p class="P3">
Until recently, I have been primarily focused on two questions:
1. Can I actually self-direct my learning?
2. Is it beneficial to emphasize self-directed learning in adult life? </p>
</ol>
<li class="L2">The Outcome <ol>
<p class="P3">My exploration so far seems to answer the above questions
positively. It has also greatly encouraged me to consider making
such self-directed learning a central part of my life.
</p>
<p class="P3">
This will mean that I will be stepping out of the &#8217;mainstream&#8217; and
to do so requires a leap of faith in myself.
</p>
<p class="P3">
I believe that by building support structures and networks to ensure
this endeavour&#8217;s productivity and sustainability, this leap can be
achieved. This is what I have shifted my focus to. I intend to take
the next semester off to explore and start building these structures
and networks. </p>
</ol>
<li class="L2">What I will be doing <ol>
<p class="P3">As a start, I will be trying to link up with people who are already
pursuing such a path and will be exploring financial &#8216;safety nets&#8217;.
</p>
<p class="P3">
So far, I have joined a couple of online mailing lists for adults
who have educated themselves without going to school. I have also
started looking into how skills could be could be tapped to provide
extra income as and when necessary.
</p>
<p class="P3">
As my exploration continues, I intend to learn more from the people
I am linking up with. If I could start a learning project in
collaboration with any of them, it would be a bonus.
</p>
<p class="P3">
I also expect myself to zoom into certain skills for deeper
consideration and be open to other means of financial &#8216;safety
nets&#8217;. </p>
</ol>
<li class="L2">Why I need the semester off <ol>
<p class="P3">The initial &#8216;push&#8217; to start off such an initiative requires a great
deal of time and &#8216;space&#8217;. Pursuing both my university course and
this experiment at the same time will lead me to neglect one over
the other or give inadequate effort for both. Once the initial
framework is in place, it should be possible to pursue both
together. </p>
