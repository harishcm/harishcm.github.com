<pre>Dear Ms Tan,

Sorry for the late reply. I was really busy over the past week. 

I would like to meet you to discuss this further, hopefully over the next week or so. Please tell me of timeslots that you will be available. I will try to fit into your schedule.

I wish to discuss about taking time off University. In addition, I wish to discuss about "Following a passion in life? How to ensure financial security?". I would like to focus on finding resources on such a topic.

For the purpose of our discussion I guess that you can consider me as someone who wants to follow a passion in life. Though many of the things that I intend to learn are for practical reasons, it might be easier that way.

I would also be appreciative if you could share your knowledge and expertise on the following topics and point out resources that I could use (if your time permits):

Having a day job and following a passion
 Jobs with flexible hours
 Working from home
 Jobs with smaller time commitment

Social Entrepreneurs / Individual Researchers
 Biographies
 How did they ensure financial security / prepare for a situation of failure

Financial Planning (esp for people who want to follow a passion)
 Resources to look at? (books, courses, talks, advisers, etc)
 People who can help?

Thank you for your assistance!

Yours Gratefully,
Harish</pre>
