<pre>Dear Sir / Madam,

I am Harish, currently in Year 1 Common Engineering. I am planning to take time off from University to focus on a personal project in self-directed learning.

It is my ambition to make self-directed learning a central part of my life. I happen to be greatly interested in broadening my scope of knowledge in fields that I personally consider to be important. However, much of what I intend to learn is not covered in mainstream formal education. Thus, I aim to be able to set aside time and effort to self-direct such learning.

I believe that pursuing such an endeavour requires me to veer off the mainstream path. This belief is of course debatable but it makes me feel a need to have a safety net in the event of "failure".

In this light, the personal project I want to focus on is about building support structures and networks to ensure the productivity and sustainability of the above endeavour.

Right now, I am interested in linking up with people who are doing something similar and exploring financial planning for such an endeavour.

I was wondering if you could point out resources / people / organisations that could assist / guide me along. Also, I would be very appreciative if you could give your comments / suggestions on my plan to take time off from University.

Thank you for your time and effort in assisting me.

Yours Sincerely,
Harish</pre>
