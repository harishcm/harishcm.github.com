<pre>Subject: Continuing our conversation

Hi Derrick,

Great meeting you at Interesthink 3. It's a pity we couldn't talk for longer.

Your choice of direction is interesting. It is a bold step and I am sure that
you have thought about, considered alternatives and planned for it.
What were some of the reasons that made you do so? 
Also, what are some of your plans for the next several months/couple years?
I'd be glad to hear what you intend to do :)

Well, NS can be a good time for exploration and experimenting,
but like you explained, it may not be easy to find time.
My experience in an infantry unit was that there was a lot of time,
but it could be disrupted at any moment as there would be sai kang to be done.
But generally I did find time to read several books.
Guess that available time is shorter when you are 8 to 5, have to include 
time to travel and stuff.

I remember you mention you being interested in setting up an organisation
that matches youngsters and organizations/companies for 
internships/apprenticeships. Did I get that right? 
Personally, I feel if you were to pull it off, it would be a great 
service to society. If you have any writings about it on your blog,
do point them out to me :)

I was reading through you blog and came across your post on the 
Wordpress plugin and the blogging community. For a long time
I felt that blogging was a passing fad thing. But many of the
sites that I read today are blogs or modelled after them. 
It's making me seriously reconsider my old opinion.
Could you introduce me to blogging and the blogging community,
what are it's various aspects? Thanks! :)

Well, do feel free to ask me anything about self-directed learning or
other stuff. The open call is still on! Have a nice week ahead!

Regards,
Harish
