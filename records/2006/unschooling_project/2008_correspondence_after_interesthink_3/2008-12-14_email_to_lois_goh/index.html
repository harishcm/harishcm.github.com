<pre>Subject: Divergence and spending time on self-directed learning 

Hi Lois,

Nice meeting you at Interesthink 3. It was interesting to hear your experiences
in self-directed learning! 

I too face issues of diverging away from the initial goal.  
Starting to learn about a single topic frequently ends up in 
explorations into so many other related topics, that the 
initial direction gets lost or gets overwhelmed. 

In many ways, I feel that the divergence issue is in fact 
an inherent perk of self-directed learning. For one, the 
several episodes of divergence made me realise that topics can be so
extremely interconnected. 
The relationships between topics are what overwhelm me most of the time, haha!
I'm glad that you are proud to have explored many 
things that other people have not! 
Could it be attributed largely to `divergence'?

One could also look at learning goals as 
moving/evolving targets, rather than as stationary ones.
Then, the freedom to diverge becomes an asset.
But, I guess that the norm in many areas (in Singapore culture??) is to 
set stationary targets. 
I also believe that setting moving targets to collaborative projects 
may be difficult. Maybe, it could be managed with slowly evolving targets,
rather than more rapidly changing moving ones.
I have not extended it to collaborative projects before though, have you?

On the other hand though, the divergence can get scary, 
especially when one lacks time or is pressured to comply to external norms.
You mentioned discipline. I'm sure that it is not easy to cope with
such issues. Hmm, could I ask, what exactly do you mean by discipline?
Defining it may help to deal with such doubts :)

We also talked about self-directed learning eating into time
that should `rightfully' be spent allocated for formal learning right? 
One of the goals of my last sem was to deal with that---
choosing which lectures to attend and stuff. 
Now waiting for my last sem's results to see how successful I was, haha!
Do tell me more about your experiences regarding this. 
I would love to hear about how you cope!


Fell free to ask me anything about self-directed learning in general. 
The open call continues :) Have a nice week ahead!

Regards,
Harish
