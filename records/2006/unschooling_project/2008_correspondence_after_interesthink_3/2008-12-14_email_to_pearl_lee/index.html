<pre>Subject: The education system and education per se 

Hello Pearl,

Was great meeting you at Interesthink 3! Unfortunately we didn't get too
much time to continue the discussion during the event.

I have to say that I respect you for your article on elitism, GEP and IP and 
your participation in The Online Citizen. 
It is great that you are going beyond school and 
participating in the real world!

When I was in secondary school (VS) and in JC (VJ), I too had many qualms
about the education system. There was always this void and many doubts over the
importance of grades. Though I guess the stress in my situation was 
nowhere near what you are experiencing---expectations that one 
should be studying 24/7 was unheard of in my situation.

Recently, I have found it helpful to view the education system
as distinct from education per se. It is unfair and perhaps even absurd to 
expect a small group of planners to know what every student in
the mainstream education needs to learn.  
Everyone is in a different situation, has different 
interests and aspirations, perhaps different abilities, etc. 
Thus realistically, one's education is one's own responsibility.
It is unfair to expect the system to carry this responsibility instead.

The education system on its own has other objectives and purposes. 
Ensuring that sufficient numbers of youngsters are trained
for jobs in the country's economy is one. 
Singapore's education system is widely considered to have 
done well in this area for many years post-1965. 
It does not require that mainstream education be 
holistic or even enriching for this objective to be achieved.
But today's economic situation makes this objective debatable though.

It is also a genuine problem for the government to ensure people accept the
jobs they end up in. Although most jobs are necessary, they come with 
different wages and benefits.  
How does the government tell some people to accept jobs with lower wages and benefits?
To gauge the true ability of people is difficult, if not impossible.
The education system however, has solved this problem in a socially acceptable 
manner thus far.
``If you don't score well, prepare to accept lower paying jobs.''
If fact, parents gladly ~pay~ for their children to be subject to  
examinations to determine their likely future job options.
Again, this has nothing to do with the ideals of education per se.

The main problem with this viewpoint though is that it proposes nothing.
It is also probably simplistic in many ways. 
But it may provide insights into less talked about aspects of the 
education system, and the problems the system currently solves. 
What do you think?

I used to be vociferous about problems with the 
educational system to my peers, parents and even principal in JC. 
But trying to take a direct sense of responsibility 
over my own education fills the void created by the system.
A side effect is that it makes me a lot less concerned about the 
system itself---which can be considered kind of selfish.

Well, feel free to ask me anything regarding self-directed learning.
The open call is still on :) It will help me in writing a website
about my experiences. Hopefully it will help you too :)

Regards,
Harish
