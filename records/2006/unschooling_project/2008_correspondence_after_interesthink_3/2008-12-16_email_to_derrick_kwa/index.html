<pre>Subject: Re: Continuing our conversation

Hi Derrick,

I liked your ending, ``keep creating''. It's something mainstream education made me forget I could do. Slowly picking it up again. It is great that you have been building on experiences and learning over the past 2 years! Yeah, there is so much to learn outside school... Your words bring about so many feelings and questions about the current state of the school system. But that's another story, haha! How have your parents and friends supported you in your pursuits? 

Hmm, linking students to colleges. Sorry I got it wrong at first. That's definitely helpful too! I'm not sure of the numbers, but I'm sure many Singaporeans go overseas for studies. And going on international exchange is hot in the local Unis these days. Do consider matching students on summer/vacation programmes as well :) Was wondering, how do you plan to gather the information? I'm thinking that it is going to involve much collaboration, and a very enriching process in itself! 

Thanks for the primer on blogging. I don't really understand it yet, but I guess it's very much about actually doing it. The fact that others comment on your posts and you comment on others---is this communication what leads to community building? I'll check out more blogs and about social media and what others have to say about it. Maybe some day I'll start blogging too :)

About myself. Well, in school I felt there was always this large void. But back then, I couldn't pin point specific reasons. I complained a lot, but didn't know what to do and didn't dare to quit. NS provided a good break, in which I set out to read about psychology, educational thought, Unschooling, adult education, etc. That confirmed many of my gut feelings and made me want to take responsibility of my own education. I started keeping records of my interests, things I learnt and resources I used.

Entering NUS Engin confirmed that the system and mindsets had not changed. It was only faster and more compressed. I realise that if I just kept following the system, the only destination was the rat-race. After 16 years of schooling, I would not have developed any alternative purpose in life or the skills, contacts and experience to pursue one. I had to develop them outside of the course. The lucky thing was that since NS, I had become confident of being able to learn things on my own. 

So, I applied to take a sem off first, got rejected and then tried again the next sem to take a year off and got accepted. Looking back, the application process was very educational in itself: convincing parents, finding support and ideas among friends, approaching the university with a self-directed purpose, being told that it was unheard of by the prof I first approached, etc. Was a surprise that NUS with all its bureaucracy approved it eventually, haha!

Having the opportunity to do what I wanted for a whole year was a different experience. I could actually put into practice what I had preached to others. I learnt about many things mainstream education missed out on. Also built on a framework for self-directed learning (keeping records, roughly organising what I do into ad-hoc interests and learning projects, etc.). Towards the end of the year, I picked up some skills in typography and for a smoother transition back to my course, did a research project module. 

I'd say that over the year I achieved the main aim: making self-directed learning a daily habit. I had explored many things, but really just touched the surface. I also didn't collaborating much with others on real world projects. It's one of the things I'm trying to improve on now :) But it was an excellent beginning and a tangible sign of repect towards my self development and towards self-directed learning.

My near future plans are to finish my Civil Engin course, while at the same time continue with my self-directed learning pursuits. I want the certificate, mainly for people to trust me in working on infrastructure projects. I am very interested in how we get our basic necessities, food, water, clear our waste, house our people, etc. NUS Engin has lots of resources, but one needs to know what one wants, and be firm about it. Most undergrads, and even some grad students I worked with don't. Sadly, general guidance is almost non-existent. But ask about specific stuff and you are likely to find an expert prof specializing in it. Weird.

On the self-directed learning side, I plan to meet and talk to people more. I still lack breadth in the kind of events I attend. Am working on it. Also working on getting a more enriching internship for the summer vacation now :) In the near future, I want to know more about Southeast Asia. Going for a work and travel programme in the US made me feel that I have not valued the rich and diverse cultures and countries that have been around me all the while.

Sorry my email has been long. Hope it was not too draggy, haha! Perhaps we could share more specific interests or things we have done over our next few emails :)

Regards,
Harish

&gt; 
&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; Yeah, it was great meeting you too. =).
&gt; 
&gt; Why I chose to quit school? Well, it was partly just being sick of the
&gt; system and the rigidity of it. And just...yeah, thinking about it, I didn't
&gt; see a point in staying? I mean, if you ask most kids why they're in school,
&gt; there's no actual reason, it's just because it's what's expected of them,
&gt; they almost haven't even thought about the possibility of doing anything
&gt; else. So yeah, got to thinking, and I realized that there was a lot more I
&gt; could learn and do and experience outside school.
&gt; 
&gt; Looking back (it's always easier in retrospect, of course), I definitely do
&gt; not regret my choice. It's been a great journey over the past 2 years -
&gt; blogging, going to events, meeting and talking to people. I've learned and
&gt; gained so much that I would never have gained elsewhere.
&gt; 
&gt; I don't really have much plans at the moment. Going to America after my NS
&gt; (in 2010), but that's about all I have planned for my future. Probably going
&gt; to college there.
&gt; 
&gt; About what I want to set up - it's about matching students with colleges.
&gt; When you look at colleges, especially in places like America, there are so
&gt; many schools, and different schools have different culture. You always hear
&gt; the phrase of "this is a great school for the right student". So what I want
&gt; to do is create a website that recommends schools based on your personality
&gt; - schools where the culture would suit you - something like what job
&gt; placement centers do for career paths. I think it'll be useful especially
&gt; for international students, who may not always get to visit colleges before
&gt; applying.
&gt; 
&gt; As for blogging, well, it's been a great journey for me. The greatest thing
&gt; about it, as i said, is the community. The type of people I've met, the
&gt; friendships I've made, the conversations that I've had. It's been amazing.
&gt; Locally, the community is still quite small - the social media scene isn't
&gt; as developed over here. But it's growing, and hopefully it'll continue to
&gt; grow.
&gt; 
&gt; Yep. What about yourself? What've you been doing?
&gt; 
&gt; Keep creating,
&gt; Derrick Kwa

&gt; &gt; Hi Derrick,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Great meeting you at Interesthink 3. It's a pity we couldn't talk for
&gt; &gt; longer.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Your choice of direction is interesting. It is a bold step and I am sure
&gt; &gt; that
&gt; &gt; you have thought about, considered alternatives and planned for it.
&gt; &gt; What were some of the reasons that made you do so?
&gt; &gt; Also, what are some of your plans for the next several months/couple years?
&gt; &gt; I'd be glad to hear what you intend to do :)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Well, NS can be a good time for exploration and experimenting,
&gt; &gt; but like you explained, it may not be easy to find time.
&gt; &gt; My experience in an infantry unit was that there was a lot of time,
&gt; &gt; but it could be disrupted at any moment as there would be sai kang to be
&gt; &gt; done.
&gt; &gt; But generally I did find time to read several books.
&gt; &gt; Guess that available time is shorter when you are 8 to 5, have to include
&gt; &gt; time to travel and stuff.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I remember you mention you being interested in setting up an organisation
&gt; &gt; that matches youngsters and organizations/companies for
&gt; &gt; internships/apprenticeships. Did I get that right?
&gt; &gt; Personally, I feel if you were to pull it off, it would be a great
&gt; &gt; service to society. If you have any writings about it on your blog,
&gt; &gt; do point them out to me :)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I was reading through you blog and came across your post on the
&gt; &gt; Wordpress plugin and the blogging community. For a long time
&gt; &gt; I felt that blogging was a passing fad thing. But many of the
&gt; &gt; sites that I read today are blogs or modelled after them.
&gt; &gt; It's making me seriously reconsider my old opinion.
&gt; &gt; Could you introduce me to blogging and the blogging community,
&gt; &gt; what are it's various aspects? Thanks! :)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Well, do feel free to ask me anything about self-directed learning or
&gt; &gt; other stuff. The open call is still on! Have a nice week ahead!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Regards,
&gt; &gt; Harish
