<pre>Subject: Sharing learning interests about the ongoing financial crisis :)

Dear Pearlyn and Duan,

Was interesting to hear that you guys are working together and
trying to learn more about the ongoing financial crisis.

I am really interested in exploring two specific issues right now.
But they are definitely extremely interconnected with
the specific issues that you guys are interested in.

Modelling a bank from set up to closure
=======================================
Part of the way banks work is through fractional reserve banking.
Basically, it means that only a small percentage of deposits is kept
with the bank, while the others are loaned out. This also means that
each time one takes a loan and spends it,
new money is being created in the economy.
However, there is definitely more to the ``story''.

For one, even with fractional reserve banking, there is still
a limit to how large the pool of money in an economy can grow.
Another gap in fractional reserve banking is that
deposits must precede loans. Another is that due to
interest being charged on loans, there will not be enough money in the economy
to repay all loans, unless brand new money
(not from fractional reserve banking) is created.

Do you guys have a clearer picture on how the banking/monetary system works?
I still have a lot of gaps in my understanding.
Two of my possible leads are "high-powered money" and "open market 
operations".
This video, [Money as Debt][MaD-vid], talks about
fractional reserve banking and high powered money in a very accessible manner.
I have yet to check the [references][MaD-ref] though on where they get their
information about high-powered money.

[MaD-vid]: http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-9050474362583451279
[MaD-ref]: http://paulgrignon.netfirms.com/MoneyasDebt/references.htm

I am interested to kind of model a bank from its set up to its closure.
Mainly to check out the legal, financial issues involved and
the effect of ``a bank'' on the economy and
any other viewpoint that pops up. haha!

Real examples of ``pumping liquidity''
======================================
I want to find answers to ``What is `pumping liquidity'?''.
The (application) process, how is access to ``liquidity'' determied, etc.
Interestingly, this is one area in which the internet come up short,
even for initial basic research. Found that weird.
Can you guys answer the question? Do you know of anyone
who might be knowledgeable in the details?

Closing
======
I would love to hear about what you guys have been exploring and your
specific/general interests! There is still a lot that I am
confused about---things that I know I don't know.
But there are definitely a super hell lot more things that
I don't even know that I don't know. haha! Bet you guys can 
enlighten me about many of them :)

Do read the postscript if you guys have time :) Also, I think that others
will also be interested in making sense of the ongoing crisis.
I know that at least Doreen, Sadu and Eugene will be.
And I bet they could bring differing perspectives!

Thanks for reading!
Harish

P.S.
Some references that I have explored:

The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable BY Nassim Nicholas Taleb
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Talks about the role of risk and the inherent problems
with how we quantify risk. He says that we usually abuse
statistics, making rare events with huge consequences
seem a hell lot more rarer than they actually are.

Cybercash: The Coming Era of Electronic Money BY Robert Guttmann
----------------------------------------------------------------
Gives an account of what it takes/took in coming up with and managing
private/public forms of electronic money. Shows how many previous
attempts failed and problems faced in implementation and acceptance.
Gives quite a bit of history about the changes in the
banking/finance/money systems, their electronization,
increase in debt in the US over the years, the switch to credit money from
commodity money, innovations in money (tradable securities/derivatives)
and issues of regulation, etc. I have the book with me, can lend you guys!

Why economic theory is out of wack BY Mark Buchanan
---------------------------------------------------
Short article. I have attached it :) I did a couple of really really simple
programs simulating economies some time back. I am interested in
the kind of simulations they talk about.

Doreen's replies to my questions on the 19thsc yahoo group in Aug 07
--------------------------------------------------------------------
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/19thsc/message/3423 and the message trail.
This was kind of my first inspiration to get started in finding out about
how the economy/financial systems work.
I think that Doreen will also be very interested in such issues :)

I think I finally got to sources like reports of the
bailout meetings they had and stuff. I think that the bailout was firstly
organising other large financial institutions to buy
over LTCM hedge fund itself and its assets.
Maybe the other financial institutions were
given cheap loans and the government secured the assets they bought over.
But I still could not confirm exactly what happened.. haha!
Maybe it's time for a rematch with the data...

My View
A story
Which I believe is wrong/lacking in many places as 
I don't have actual data to analyse. 
Even with actual data there is always the problem of 
incomplete information.

Background

Banks
Loan givers. Fractional reserve banking.		

Packaging loans as tradable securities. 
Security was that it could be traded away when not in favour anymore, 
chance of capital gains, and 
no necessity for direct involvement in borrower's affairs.
However, I have not seen real or example contracts, 
heard that they are usually represented simply as a monetary value,
similar to stocks.
