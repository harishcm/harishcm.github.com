<li class="L2">Activity <ol>
<li class="L3">Travelling to NUS from Dover MRT and Vice-Versa with inline skates <ol>
<li class="L4">Experience <ol>
<p class="P5">The distance and slopes are fine. Skating the route at night
is also fine. The only difficult terrain is the flyover
where the path is lined with uneven concrete drain covers.
</p>
<p class="P5">
The pollution is more manageable as I need to breathe less
when I am skating than when I am running. Still it is a
concern. </p>
</ol>
</ol>
</ol>
</ol>
<li class="L1">2009-08-13 <ol>
<li class="L2">Failure <ol>
<li class="L3">Seeking a less polluted route from NUS to Dover MRT <ol>
<p class="P4">I tried to find a route from the Sports and Recreation Centre
across the Ayer Rajah Expressway and towards Dover MRT.
</p>
<p class="P4">
The walking routes I tried all involve skirting around ITE
College West, ACS Independent, United World College, and
Singapore Polytechnic. This adds considerably to the distance.
</p>
<p class="P4">
Further, the section of the route along the Ayer Rajah
Expressway is moderately polluted. The fact that I need to get
to the Sports and Recreation Centre from the Engineering Faculty
first is a minor concern.
</p>
<li class="L4">Idea <ol>
<p class="P5">Possibly I could find routes to Buona Vista or Clementi
Interchange instead. A longer distance is perfectly fine on
inline skates or on a bicycle. </p>
</ol>
</ol>
</ol>
<li class="L2">Activity <ol>
<li class="L3">Travelling to NUS from Dover MRT by Running <ol>
<li class="L4">Inspiration <ol>
<p class="P5">I am pretty irritated with taking bus 96 from Clementi
MRT to NUS. During the peak hours, it can easily
take half-an-hour to get from Clementi MRT to NUS
and vice-versa. Further, the amount of pollution at the
Clementi MRT area is disturbing.
</p>
<p class="P5">
I recognise that I can take bus 183 during the morning peak
hours and achieve a shorter travel time. Still, it does not
work during the evening peak hours. </p>
</ol>
<li class="L4">Experience <ol>
<p class="P5">It took me about 15min for the run from Dover MRT to NUS.
This was with the heavily polluted path along Clementi Road,
especially at the flyover just before reaching NUS.
</p>
<p class="P5">
The distance is definitely feasible, but I do not want to
experience the pollution. </p>
</ol>
<li class="L4">Thought <ol>
<p class="P5">Maybe skating the distance would feel better. </p>
</ol>
</ol>
</ol>
</ol>
<li class="L1">2009-05-27 <ol>
<li class="L2">Activity <ol>
<li class="L3">Recce along the Southern Ridges for a skating route <ol>
<li class="L4">Experience <ol>
<p class="P5">The night before I decided to take a jog along the Southern
Ridges series of parks and park connectors. The main aim was
to recce for possible skating routes to NUS from the east.
And I also wanted to get to NUS by 6.30pm, in time to play
soccer with friends.
</p>
<p class="P5">
It appears that with exception of the Marang Trail, the
other sections are skatable. However, there are some
sections requiring real skating proficiency - narrow slopes,
handrail-less staircases, and pavement-less but low-traffic
roads.
</p>
<p class="P5">
Many sections of the path can get hot. So, planning for or
carrying water will be great :) I completed the jog in 2h,
but it really was not easy, with the slopes, heat, and a
little traffic fumes at places.
</p>
<p class="P5">
Maybe, someday, I will actually attempt an actual skate
session :) </p>
