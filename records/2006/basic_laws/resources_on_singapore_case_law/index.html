Dear Harish,

LawNet is a service provided by the Singapore Academy of Law, and is the most
authoritative source of Singapore's legal information.

The National Library does not subscribe to LawNet nor any other similar
database. But we do have other research tools which are useful. Please see the
below resources. You may also wish to log on to the Online Catalogue ht tp://
vistaweb.nlb.gov.sg --&gt; Search 'Law Singapore' --&gt; Select 'Browse by Subjects'
--&gt; Browse the other law publications.

If you are a library member with the National University of Singapore, you will
find their subscribed databases useful (in addition to LawNet - Legal
Workbench):
(1) LexisNexis
(2) Singapore &amp; Malaysian Case Law Library
(3) Westlaw
