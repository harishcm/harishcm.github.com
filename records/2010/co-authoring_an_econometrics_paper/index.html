</div>
<div class="MainPage">
<ol>
<li class="L1">Inspiration <ol>
<p class="P2">Sadu came up to me and asked if I would be interested to co-author an
econometrics paper with him. We would probably be publishing it in a
tier-three journal.
</p>
<p class="P2">
It sounded like an interesting idea and I wanted to see how it turned
out. </p>
</ol>
<li class="L1">Ideas <ol>
<li class="L2">Tracking Singapore&#8217;s GDP/GNP/GINI/Quality of life over the years <ol>
<p class="P3">Why was Singapore still a 3rd world country at independence although
it had been an &#8220;impregnable fortress&#8221; and &#8220;the light of the south&#8221;. </p>
</ol>
<li class="L2">A calculation of wasted productivity <ol>
<p class="P3">Motivation theory seems to suggest that for creative and
undeterministic work, a high level of reward degrades performance
significantly. For routine, deterministic work however, a higher
reward increases productivity.
</p>
<p class="P3">
There has been much talk about the knowledge economy over the years,
and jobs in the knowledge are touted to be more undeterministic and
require more creativity.
At the same time however, inequality in pay has risen exponentially.
</p>
<p class="P3">
Coming up with figures and methodologies for calculating the amount
of wasted productivity will be socially valuable.
</p>
<li class="L3">Questions <ol>
<li class="L4">How would we define productivity?
<li class="L4">What are some of the existing definitions? </ol>
</ol>
<li class="L2">Oracles of our time: Who can predict better? <ol>
<li class="L3">Compare prediction ability between different professionals and experts
<li class="L3">Information sources <ol>
<li class="L4">High level published reports
<li class="L4">Newspapers
<li class="L4">Press reports </ol>
<li class="L3">Focus <ol>
<li class="L4">Predictions that are part of day to day work?
<li class="L4">Predictions that affect many people subsequently? </ol>
<li class="L3">Possible conclusions <ol>
<li class="L4">Professions/professionals who are hopeless at predicting <ol>
<li class="L5">Is it meaningful to support them? </ol>
</ol>
</ol>
<li class="L2">Simulating structural tendencies of our current monetary infrastructure <ol>
<li class="L3">Hypothesis <ol>
<li class="L4">Unfettered growth is a necessity in the current system </ol>
<li class="L3">Methods <ol>
<li class="L4">Shock the system and see what happens </ol>
<li class="L3">Further investigations <ol>
<li class="L4">Play out scenarios <ol>
<li class="L5">What if all waste was recycled back into raw materials <ol>
<p class="P6">As happens in nature. </p>
</ol>
</ol>
<li class="L4">Propose changes to current monetary infrastructure <ol>
<li class="L5">Monetary infrastructure for closing the waste loop </ol>
</ol>
</ol>
<li class="L2">Solving problems of the world today: Changes to the current accounting system <ol>
<p class="P3">Although rural people have much land and other natural and
livelihood infrastructure and resources, these are not taken into
account in current accounting practice. This is one of the reasons
for the income gap between rural and urban people.
</p>
<p class="P3">
For instance, trees could be classified as assets that grow over
time. This however requires recognition of the uses and benefits of
trees. Resources are only valuable when we know what they can be
used for (even if it is aesthetic or spiritual).
</p>
<li class="L3">Green accounting
<li class="L3">Needs much more development however </ol>
<li class="L2">How much energy can we sustainably consume? <ol>
<li class="L3">A fact finding mission to facilitate the global energy debate
<li class="L3">Outline <ol>
<li class="L4">Find amount of solar energy reaching different layers <ol>
<li class="L5">Ground level
<li class="L5">Tropospheric layers
<li class="L5">Stratospheric layers </ol>
<li class="L4">Find amount of solar energy absorbed at different layers
<li class="L4">Current state of technology to trap the energy
<li class="L4">Environmental impact assessment for the various technologies
<li class="L4">Recommendations </ol>
</ol>
<li class="L2">Saving ourselves from the brink: The use of safety factors in economic policy and management <ol>
<p class="P3">In engineering design, safety factors are commonly introduced to
compensate for varibility and uncertainty. Sometimes
<em>Reliability Analysis</em> is used to deal with uncertainties.
</p>
<p class="P3">
There are at least 3 types of uncertainty recognised in engineering:
inherent uncertainty, statistical uncertainty, and model uncertainty.
Additionally, uncertainty can also be categorized as ontological
uncertainty (fundamental randomness) or epistemological
uncertainty (lack of knowledge).
</p>
<p class="P3">
In any case, engineering already has the tools and methods for
dealing with uncertainty in rational ways, which have proved
successful over time. It would be interesting to apply such tools
and methods to economics, especially since much data is available. </p>
</ol>
</ol>
<li class="L1">My Intentions <ol>
<li class="L2">Link to current concepts and references from fields outside economics <ol>
<li class="L3">Motivation theory
<li class="L3">Ecological value assignment
<li class="L3">Geography and anthropology </ol>
</ol>
