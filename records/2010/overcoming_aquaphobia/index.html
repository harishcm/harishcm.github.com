<li class="L1">Inspiration <ol>
<p class="P2">I can now swim laps of the swimming pool using breaststroke. It
often feels uncomfortable, but it gets better as I train.
With correct knowledge and training, I know that I am capable of so much
more. </p>
</ol>
<li class="L1">Background <ol>
<p class="P2">I have been afraid of water since I was very young. Both my parents
could not swim, and thus they did not take me to the pool either.
At that time, I was also very afraid of things that were unknown and
seldom tried out new things.
</p>
<p class="P2">
Once, when I was about 5 years old, I was brought to be pool by my mum
and the lady who was staying in my house as a tenant.
When introduced to the water by my tenant, I was holding onto her arm
tightly, refusing to let go. After extended encouragement, I was finally
made to let go.
Upon letting go, I panicked and struggled. Water got into my nose. It
felt like I was drowning. And that was the end of swimming for a long
time, up until swimming lessons in secondary school (12 years of age).
</p>
<p class="P2">
In secondary school, there were compulsory swimming lessons for
everyone, especially because the swimming pool was a 5 minute jog from
the school compound. It was a traumatic experience, accompanied with
embarrassment. After 10 weeks, while most of the others passed, I
was just putting my head into the water. Those who did not pass had to
do a re-course. This time around there were only a handful of students,
and the coach was much more supportive. By the end of the second 10 weeks,
I could do 3 single strokes of the breaststroke, but I could not
tread water. Looking back at those days always brings a smile.
</p>
<p class="P2">
Over the years, my friends have helped me out in improving my swimming.
Eugene Koh, Priscilla, Saravanan and Kin Fei were instrumental in
providing with encouragement, support, and positive peer pressure in
bettering my swimming. A three month stint as a shallow water lifeguard
at a water theme park improved my confidence quite a bit.
Without my friends, I would have never thought of attempting the stint
at the water theme park.
</p>
<p class="P2">
My greatest achievement so far has been to swim about 300&#8211;400m in calm
open water. I was surrounded by friends assuring me that they would save
me if I were to drown. </p>
