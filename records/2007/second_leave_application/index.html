<li class="L1">About The Author <ol>
<p class="P2">The Author, who prefers to be called Harish, was born in 1985 in
Singapore. He is now in National University of Singapore, pursuing a
first degree in Civil Engineering.
</p>
<p class="P2">
His secondary school days were spent in Victoria School and then he went
on to Victoria Junior College. It was during his junior college days
that he frequently thought about the meaning in schooling and
encountered the dilemma of allocating of time, resources and energy to
both formal and informal learning.
</p>
<p class="P2">
During his National Service he made time to learn a little more into the
fields of psychology and educational research & thought. Thereafter, he
began taking his informal education more seriously and started keeping
records of his learning.
</p>
<p class="P2">
When the author was twenty years old, general elections were held in
Singapore. He followed the election happenings actively and was shocked
to realise that he knew next to nothing about how his country was run-
even though he would be old enough to vote the following year.
</p>
<p class="P2">
Using the surge in momentum caused by the shock and the time he had
before entering his University course, he began to assemble a plausible
solution to his dilemma and his lack of knowledge.
</p>
<p class="P2">
He realised that it was unfair and unrealistic to expect schooling to
provide for all learning ventures. Thus, other means of education had to
be sought to compliment schooling. And much of these other means of
education would have to be self ascertained and sought after.
</p>
<p class="P2">
He hypothesized that by bringing both his formal and informal education
under the same “umbrella” they could be made to compliment one another.
Allocation of time, energy & resources to both could also be bettered.
This in effect meant Directing his Education himself.
</p>
<p class="P2">
Though he felt that he had a plausible solution, he also felt then that
he was still not capable enough to achieve it.
</p>
<p class="P2">
He however saw that he could take the initial steps by doing three things:
* Improving his Knowledge in areas he felt were vital
* Building Structure and Credibility in his informal education and
* Making Self-directed Learning a well assimilated Habit in his daily life
</p>
<p class="P2">
He grew in confidence when he realised that many of the great
influential people throughout history were self-taught individuals or
individuals who excelled in fields that they were never schooled in.
</p>
<p class="P2">
The author is currently in active pursuit of the three initial steps
that will he feels will enable him to direct his education himself. He
has tried serious Self-directed Learning on a full-time basis in the six
months before entering his University course and has experienced the
sense of fulfillment and widening in internal locus of control it
brings.
</p>
<p class="P2">
His plan is influenced greatly by the methods and philosophies held by
Homeschooling and Unschooling Communities and by the authors John Holt,
Grace Llewllyn and Charles D. Hayes. He has however been wary to ensure
that his methods and ideas are localised to his specific context and
situation in Singapore.
</p>
<p class="P2">
The author expects to make a profession in the field of education in the future. </p>
</ol>
<li class="L1">What do I intend to Learn next? <ol>
<p class="P2">What I intend to learn next is somewhat similar to a Liberal Arts
Education. However, I will not have readily available professors to
guide me- I will be seeking the resources and guidance myself. Keep in
mind that the following are the result of Ad-hoc Interests and more
Interests will pop out along the way.
</p>
<li class="L2">Human Nature and Psychology <ol>
<p class="P3">Having learnt introductory Psychology, I intend to delve a little
into Social Psychology, possibly both from a Psychologist&#8217;s and a
Sociologist&#8217;s viewpoint. </p>
</ol>
<li class="L2">Money Supply and the Capitalist Economy <ol>
<p class="P3">Knowing exactly how our currencies originated and how they work has
always been a wish of mine. I will be learning by pressing toward
this goal while learning the required theories as and when I need
them. I intend to also constantly consult experts in the field and
my friends who are more knowledgeable than me. Towards the end, I
expect to have a foundation in macroeconomics while learning the
necessary microeconomic theories along the way. </p>
</ol>
<li class="L2">Sales, Marketing, Business, Finance and Logistics <ol>
<p class="P3">I intend to get a overview on the content and knowledge gained by
students in the above fields. I mainly want to be able to understand
the basic lingo used in these fields and be able to strike a
conversation about these topics. Also, I would be focusing on seeing
the links between the above fields and the knowledge (e.g. in the
sciences) that I have already gained thus far. It is likely that I
will be mainly involved with introductory textbooks and students in
these fields. </p>
</ol>
<li class="L2">Basic Law in Singapore <ol>
<p class="P3">Having realised the significance of the Constitution through my
self-directed learning, I intend to commit some of its clauses to
memory. I also intend to get an overview of Singapore Law in the
fields that are of interest to me. </p>
</ol>
<li class="L2">Nutrition and the Half-an-hour meal <ol>
<p class="P3">I am considering stopping eating meats and seafood mass produced by
the industry due to my suspicions about their feed, rearing methods
and state of health when slaughtered. I intend to instead consume
more from lower down the food-chain so as to minimize possible
adverse health effects. Also, I want to investigate on my suspicions
and learn more about vegetarianism while changing my diet slowly.
Part of this will be to practice cooking meals for myself within
half an hour. </p>
</ol>
<li class="L2">Exercise as a Daily Habit <ol>
<p class="P3">Currently, I know several exercises that can be done without going
to a gym, that stretch and work out every major muscle group in the
body. I intend to organise these exercises together into a form that
can be done as a daily habit and assimilate them into my daily life.
I also intend to learn more from experienced personal trainers and
read up about the bio-mechanics and physiology behind these
exercises. </p>
</ol>
<li class="L2">Inline Skating Proficiency and Instruction <ol>
<p class="P3">An example of the diverse range of topics I intend to cover, skating
proficiency requires understanding of theory and methods and putting
them into practice. I also intend to be trained as an instructor. </p>
</ol>
<li class="L2">Videography <ol>
<p class="P3">Videos play a huge role in the mass media. I intend to learn what it
takes to film and edit videos of reasonable quality to add to the
skills I have. </p>
</ol>
<li class="L2">Biographies of Select People <ol>
<p class="P3">I intend to first read general overviews of biographies of Martin
Luther King, Mohandas Gandhi, Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin,
Albert Einstein, etc. I will then be investigating further into
areas of their lives that I find interesting and useful for me to
know about. </p>
</ol>
</ol>
<li class="L1">Summary <ol>
<li class="L2">About The Author <ol>
<p class="P3">The Author, who prefers to be called Harish, was born in 1985 in
Singapore. In his Primary School days he realised that he would
alsways get a good name, because of his grades and character in
front of adults even if he was mischevious behind their backs. He
however, did not like keeping up the two-faced act and so eventually
decided to be the same everywhere.
</p>
<p class="P3">
His secondary school days were spent in Victoria School, one of the
premier all-boys government schools in Singapore. Here he felt a
sense of pride and ownership for something much larger than himself-
the VS spirit. He also made long lasting friends who helped him
overcoming a stutter, urged him to improve his demeanour and still
support him to this day. He also met great teachers who he then
aspired to emulate one day.
</p>
<p class="P3">
The Author then went on the Victoria Junior College where he made it
into the Students&#8217; Council. He feels glad about the huge amounts of
time he spent with his fellow Councillors in the Council Room and
while doing Council-related activities. He got to see the
amalgamation of very differnet schools of thought and the amazing
tangible results the amalgamation produced. He also got to realise
that this was due to the intelligence and dedication within and
across all ranks in the Council and the fact that the Council had
friends who were ever-willing to render much needed help.
</p>
<p class="P3">
However, it was also here that he encountered the dilemna regarding
the allocation of time, resources and energy to formal and informal
learning. He was also involved in a mental tumoil about the meaning
in formal schooling.
</p>
<p class="P3">
He then went on to serve his National Serivce which showed him what
it was like to be a small, completely replacable part of a large
organization. It was also here that he made time to learn a little
more into the fields of psychology and educational thought.
</p>
<p class="P3">
After National Service, he began taking his informal education more
seriously. It was election time and the author was 20 then. He was
shocked to realise that he knew next to nothing about how his
country was run, even though he would be old enough to vote the
following year.
</p>
<p class="P3">
Over time, he began to assemble a possible solution to his turmoil,
dilemna and shock about his lack of knowledge. He hypothesized that
he would have to Direct his Education himself. That would efectively
mean brining both his formal and informal education under the same
&#8220;umbrella&#8221;, where they could be made to compliment one another.
Also, resources could be allocated better as both formal and
informal education now complimented one another.
</p>
<p class="P3">
He felt however, that he was still not capable enough to achieve
such an ongoing feat but saw that he could poaaibly achieve it by
improving his knowledge in certain areas, building structure and
credibility for his informal education and making learning a well
assimmilated part of his daily life.
</p>
<p class="P3">
He grew in confidence when he realised that a huge number of famous
names were self-taught individuals or individuals who excelled in
fields that they were never schooled in.
</p>
<p class="P3">
The author&#8217;s current plan is influenced greatly by the methods and
philosophies held by Homeschooling and Unschooling Communities and
by the authors John Holt, Grace Llewllyn and Charles D. Hayes. The
author has however ensured that his methods and philosophies are
localised to his context and situation in Singapore.
</p>
<p class="P3">
In the future, it is likely that the author will make a profession
in the field of education. </p>
</ol>
<li class="L2">Preface <ol>

one year. It has been especially fitted into a single page so that
