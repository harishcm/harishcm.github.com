<pre>Dear Prof Somsak,

Thank you for your advice, time and support during our first meeting.

As requested by you, I did go back home and reflect on whether I need the year long leave of absence. I also thrashed it out with a few of my friends. 

Sir, after the past two days, I feel that I should go ahead with the leave of absence, even if it is difficult to secure. 

I feel that it is worth the time, effort and resources to push for something that I really want to do but at the same time I realise that I need be cautious not to become obsessed with my pursuits. For now, I still choose to go ahead with the leave of absence.

Also, a new idea sprung up over the past two days. It will be beneficial if I were to be watched over by a mentor while I carry out my learning pursuits. He / she can ensure that I keep heading the right direction while leaving me the space and freedom to pursue my learning. I could report my progress to him / her once every fortnight or so. 

I have attached an updated and more complete copy of the document I gave you. The copy I gave to you only covers what I intended to talk about during our first meeting and a little more. 

Please take note that the document was originally meant as a personal record. The way it is written is to facilitate quick re-reading of concepts that that one is already familiar with. You will be able to understand it better if I am given an opportunity to do a short presentation of 'What I intend to do Over the next One Year'.

Sir, I will be glad if you could arrange for a short presentation of my plan to the Heads of Department and / or Deans. I think that can lead us to more efficient discussion of how to move forward.

Once again thank you for giving me the initial opportunity to meet up with you. You may better understand my position after a short presentation.

Yours,
Mohanadas Harish Chandar
