<pre>Dear Professor,

I am Harish, going into Civil Engineering Year 2 from Common Engineering. I met up and talked to you last semester regarding choosing Civil Engineering during my Streaming exercise.

Sir, I have pursued Self-Directed Learning for more than a year now, on and off.

Now, I am trying to make Self-Directed Learning a Habit that is well integrated into my Daily Life. I intend it to be a daily Habit, not too different from brushing our teeth or taking the bus to work.

To be brief, I intend to do this by continuing my self-directed learning, now paying special attention to assimilating such learning into my daily life. For instance, I will be improving on simple but essential habits, such as carrying around writing materials wherever I go, and cultivating new ones. I will also be 'shock testing' the Flexibility and Adaptability of my learning to changes in my schedules / situations. Of course, I will be doing a lot of other things such as Keeping Records, Organising my Learning and Improving my Learning Skills and Resources. Also of great interest will be linking up with people as part of the learning process.

In today's fast changing world, the importance of being able to self-direct one's own Education does not need much argument.

Cultivating habits and integrating them into daily life takes patience, discipline and most importantly time in hand. 

In this light, I intend to take a Year-long leave of absence from NUS to enable me to make Self-Directed Learning a Habit that is well integrated into my Daily Life.

I am of course willing to give more material explaining what I intend to do over the next one year. Please direct me to the relevant people and / or procedures I have to follow up in order to secure the leave of absence.

Sir, Thank You for your time and effort in this regard!

Yours Sincerely,
Mohanadas Harish Chandar
U067314J
