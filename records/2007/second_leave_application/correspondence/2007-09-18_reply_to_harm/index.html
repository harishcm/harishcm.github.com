<pre>Hey Harm! I guess that replying after a few days is the norm. haha! Maybe we need a few days before our thoughts settle down to a focus. But I took more than a week. Sorry abt it man.


&gt;&gt; Some comments and stuff I'm unclear about though (maybe because I'm quite ignorant about the whole self directed learning method)

It's great that you brought up stuff that were unclear! Firstly, I don't think you are ignorant- there are no standard methods to self-directed learning. Everyone does it in his / her own way: self-directed.

As a whole, my methods are heavily influenced by the Unschooling and Homeschooling communitites. But I am definitely strongly influenced by other sources, particularly Schooling. So I guess, my methods will be kind of a mix of the above three. (Interesting that I look at them as '~methods~ of learning' here. haha!)

How did I come up with my methods? 
1. I got ideas from some source (books, friends, self &amp; family &amp; societal pressure)
2. I got the idea out of nowhere (those sudden sparks you get). I recorded it down on paper i carried around.. Then I organized these ideas while transferring them into electronic form. 
3. I tried to follow the methods, modifying what I do as the methods themselves evolved.


&gt;&gt; What do you mean by bringing under the same umbrella? 

I meant that I want both my formal and informal education to be managed by myself- with help and advice from others of course. It's necessary to be that way from now on anyway I guess, us being in Uni.

I used the umbrella analogy to highlight that things can be more coordinated and complimentary if both formal and informal education were seen and managed as one joint entity, rather than as two disjoint ones. I'll improve on the way I say it though. Thanks man! 


&gt;&gt; Does it mean allocating the same amount of resources to both formal and informal education?

I guess allocation of resources will depend on the situation and my priorities and the nature of the learning involved. But taking equal allocation as a general guideline may help.


&gt;&gt; Documenting your learning projects. I think it would be awesome if you could give some documentation examples, it will improve the credibility of your plan.

Yup thats true. I'll be putting them up on a website soon. It's one of the things I'm working on right now actually.

Showcasing my records publicly will allow others to better evaluate what I am doing. I understand that people will start evaluating things based on whatever information they have. So it is better to make it easily available. haha!

I have attached a couple of my records of learning projects in this email. 

It's possible that I will be changing the format of my records. I am facing scalability issues with the current way of keeping records. 

What happens when the
 Amount of information becomes very large? 
 Records span over long periods of time?
  With large 'gaps' between them?


&gt;&gt; What are your long term plans? 

I don't have plans for the next 10 years or longer. I feel that I am not fiercely passionate about anything in particular. I could say some general statement like I'd like to lead a balanced life, like to do a business, but a general statement is not a plan you see. So I guess I don't have any. I will leave it at 'exploring'.


&gt;&gt; You were telling me that you hoped to find a sustainable means of committing to this method for your life, do you still intend to do this?

When I talked to you about this, I felt that I was going completely out of the norm by trying to learn things on my own. It was partly due to fear of the 'unknown' and also other unwarranted fears such as becoming 'destitute' and stuff, haha! I guess it was a natural reaction.

Now, I see it as something that adds value instead. A solution to the problem of lack of basic knowledge, skills and experience- possibly due to years being 'schooled'. So I don't 'need' the sustainable means that I used to talk about. But I'm keeping the idea of means of income other than the norm day job. 


&gt;&gt; I think, if you do hope to find  sustainable means, entrepeneurship could be a very useful area to look into.

Yup! Entreprenuership is a means that I am considering. To be truthful, I am fearful of it. haha! I think mainly because I have never seen how anyone has done it before. My dad did a business but never showed me what he was doing. What a waste! haha!


&gt;&gt; I just met a family friend yesterday, he works for Shell. He's doing his masters in University of Chicago, and one of his electives are entrepeneurship. It involves knowing about the nitty-grittys of starting from scratch. NUS has some workshops on these too right, it may be useful stuff for you, especially if one of your adhoc interests turns out to be a feasible idea!

Yup! I think I will be trying to get into the NOC programme in Sweden. I might enroll in a couple of the entrepreneurship courses in NUS if I can't get NOC. Hmm, I'll check out MIT OpenCourseware on entrepreneurship too.


&gt;&gt; Just thought I tell you something about your strengths, I'm not sure how it will help you but I know it may help others to benefit from your strengths while you are in this process. 

All your views and comments are of help man! It helps me understand how others view what I am doing better.


&gt;&gt; I think you make a good social counsellor! I personally find that you are a person who rationalises a lot. Not many people can do this nowadays. And rationalising amidst the stress, even fewer can do. That's why I feel that most people feel good after speaking to you, especially if it is about problems and stress issues.

Interesting... haha! To be sure, there are several times that I am confused and lost. For one: The food we eat daily. I've been hearing lots of scary tales about it. Yet to converge on what I should eat on a daily basis. 

You know what, I thought about it. I guess that I am very at ease when speaking to you. You are one of the few that I dare tell all the things that I think about. I guess it starts from the nonjudgemental attention you give. You bring out the best in me man.


&gt;&gt; Something not in the document - how do you plan to change the way you interact with others, like your friends etc? 

I intend to spend more time with friends, especially having intellectual conversations with them. Arranging meetups over lunch seems like an idea. haha! But I've not been doing that for a month now- meeting for lunch.


&gt;&gt; I find this a problem with myself, I'm curious. I find that time with people who mean a lot to you(friends, family) is sacrificed because of our aims in life. 

Yup, that is the common notion. I guess it largely depends on your aims and how you go about pursuing them. Also, on how much time you intend to spend with family. What are your aims? How do you plan to go about pursuing them?


&gt;&gt; Apart from networking with other people, do you plan to change yourself internally, the way you are?

I'm trying to cultivate habits, and then stress test them- do other things, change my schedules and see what happens. I may change internally considerably. One aspect I see myself changing (and wanting to change) is in the amount of respect I accord to people. 

I want to give a lot less respect those in authority / high post / great professions / booming business. I want to respect them as humans, not anything more. Yes give them credit for their contributions, but treat them as equals. I mean 'none of them has saved the world'. Lots of them are making it worse off than before. haha!

On the other hand, I want to respect those younger / less well to do / peers more. We are capable of a lot more than what we did in school. There is no difference in intelligence / creativity between me and a 17 yr old. He / she can learn and create the same things if they were accorded similar guidance, opportunity, respect and support. I feel that I should respect all as equally as possible.


&gt;&gt; Some contacts if they appear useful: 

Thanks Harm! I'll get in touch with you if I need help in these areas (maybe later in the year or when I'm back in NUS). I'd love to meet any of them for a friendly chat. haha!

Right now, I'm intending to get in touch with people in the local food trade and inspection areas. But there's quite a bit of inertia (doubts, slight fear) in me. But I will do it soon.


&gt;&gt; If you're interested in the domain of inter-faith activity/interaction, there's this  inter-faith youth group who basically get to know more about each other's faiths through activities!

I think I know of two guys in the group- Veerappan and SaiFul Anwar. Do you know them? And tell me about any activities they have. I'm interested to come down.


&gt;&gt; Ok that's all I can think about for now. Hope it has helped!

It sure did man! I appreciate the time and effort you put in to read my email and compose yours!


In Conclusion:

Sorry that the email had to be so long man. I really don't expect a reply... With school work and stuff. haha! I'll come down to NUS soon. Will catch up on you then. I'd love to hear your aims and how they compete with time you'd want to spend with your loved ones!




-          Some contacts if they appear useful:

 

o   I know a guy who's managing one of A-Star's department finances, quite a
big shot. Jasbir Singh. If you need anything to do with links in Astar, let
me know!

o   A friend of mine's doing a PhD in some accounts/business/ something like
that in Michigan State University. He's from VJ too, and he's got the same
name as me! Haha, he's an AWESOME guy in terms of networking, or any money
related stuff. More on the accounting/business side. He's a REALLY REALLY
nice guy too, so if you need, I can link you up with him! He's been my
mentor for a long time now, and my role model too!

o   Social services/IT - I think ian cheng's dad is awesome to tap into for
this area. He seems to be a really big shot with both these areas. Big
philantrophist, IT savvy guy. I think Eugene may have lots of good ocntacts
here too, he's quite into the social service.

o   Media -Ian cheng's dad again! Haha, he's got connections with channel 5,
that's how ian got work at the media place during his vacation here.

§  I took a module last sem on "Sonic arts and sound". The rpof's really
nice, he used to work for ifocomm development authority as a reasearcher
(sound engineer). If you ened any info to do with sound systems or
technology, can ask him!

o   More IT stuff. I know this guy who is a networks engineer for some
german company in singapore. Just met him last week at the temple, he's from
india. Also, one of our Sikh Society members is quite a pro at these related
areas. He took a one year break before entering university to work for this
company and to IT projects with them! Seems like a real pro, he's at the
school of computing right now, year 2 student. He may get you links in India
if you need to tie up with them in any way.

o   Psychology - perhaps you can get Eugene's proffessors? He's doing
psychology right. If not, I think my friend's doing that too at SMU. Can get
some links with the profs.

o   If you're interested in the domain of inter-faith activity/interaction,
there's this  inter-faith youth group who basically get to know more about
each other's faiths through activities! 

 

Ok that's all I can think about for now. Hope it has helped! Hope to meet up
with you soon!

 

=)

God bless!
