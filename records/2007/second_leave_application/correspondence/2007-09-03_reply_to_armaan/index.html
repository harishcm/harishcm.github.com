<pre>Hey Bro,

I'm grateful for your comments man... It helps me understand how others perceive what I intend to do.

From what you said, I feel that this Summary is skewed to the 'product' aspect of what I intend to do. 
I guess this is largely because I wrote this mainly as a supporting document for my leave application.

To be put things into another perspective, the main thing that I want to achieve is assimilation of self-directed learning into my daily life.
This I feel should be done at the same time as building structures to improve the credibility of self-directed learning and getting basic knowledge in areas that I feel are important.
One way to think about it is that these two are still secondary to assimilation aim. Another way is to think that these are part and parcel of being able to assimilate.
I am trying to think more long term here, this year intended mainly to be an enabler (for the years to come)..

Actually, my greatest fear right now is that when I rejoin NUS, my informal learning comes crashing down again. 
Though I have seen and felt the recovery of informal learning during period of holiday or break, I want it to continue throughout the term.
I'm planning for that too..

It will be interesting to see if I can come up with that amount of discipline and 'rigor' in my informal learning. 
I don't expect things to be done systematically or in an orderly manner though. Quite the opposite- chaotic, random and opportunistic but also planned..
Record keeping will then bring organization into the stuff that I learn.. Having this 'extra' thing to do will be a challenge..

Another thing that I realise I have to deal with is the fear of failure.. it is something that can consume me during this year..
Everything that I intend to do, are things that we all have done separately and are capable of doing... bringing them together is the challenge..

Right now, I'm reading a couple of books.. Soon I'll be getting my record keeping up to date. 
Then, see how things go.. probably will be doing a few learning projects while maybe making a website of what I am doing and intend to do..

You are too humble man... Bio-mechanics is one area that you are very knowledgeable... 
I saw that in the way you showed me about the way the upper leg moves when pivoting about the knee...
Looking forward to working with u in that...

Work on your "road to perfection" man... I'm sure many others are like us, wanting to learn more about several of those areas..
If possible read up a little on educational thought (i recommend John Holt) and about motivation and memory in psychology textbooks.. It helped me chart quite a bit of my plans..

Hope you have a good time in NUS man.. I'll be coming on Wed.. Guess I'll see you then.. After your classes for the day..

Have Fun!
Harish
