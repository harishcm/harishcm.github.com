<pre>Hey everyone! How are you guys doing! Hope things are going well!

Currently, I'm on a year-long leave from NUS. I guess that it could
be called a gap year... I've been planning this for some time
already but was never sure of whether my leave application will be
granted. Then interestingly, my leave app was approved a couple of
weeks back.

I took the leave to indulge myself in self-directed learning. My main aim is 
to cultivate habits that will allow me to carry out productive 
self-directed learning while doing other things at the same time 
(school, work, etc.)

For the past two weeks, I have been reading books and getting into steam. Now
I'm also getting records of things that I learn up to date.. They
have been unkept for a while...

I've attached a brief summary of what I intend to do over the next
one year. It's in a pdf file. This was the same document that I sent
in for my leave app (except that I edited a few spelling
mistakes)... I'll also upload a copy into the files section...

Please comment on the brief summary! Especially on things that I can
improve and things that are not clear... If you give frank
comments, it will help me more.. Thanks!

Regards,
Harish
