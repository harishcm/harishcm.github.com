<pre>Hey Harm! 

Attached is a brief summary of what I intend to do in the next one year (pdf
file)... I've been trying to tell everyone, slowly, one at a time.. i better
speed up though.. haha! Please comment on the document, especially on what
pitfalls I should avoid, segments that are unclear and parts that are
redundant.. Thanks man!

On what I'm doing now- I am currently reading a few books... soon I will be
getting the records of my learning up to date... they have been kind of
unkept when in the US and when i entered NUS... then i will be doing several
learning projects... I am also currently planning what I could do as a
finale to the year..

On the issue of linking up with people... this is one of my main focuses...
I'm trying to get my NUS mentor to be a guide for this year too.. but see
how.. I plan to link up with a couple of my former teachers and do a
learning project with them.. but must have more substantial and varied
sources of documentation of what I am doing first.. to ascertain
credibility... haha! maybe a full sized document (I got it in point form
now) and a website... 

a couple of days back, I sent an email to the director of the national
council of social service about beggars at the MRTs I frequent- including
Clementi... one of the first attempts in making it natural to link up with
people... He hasn't replied.. haha! i plan to send email to a couple of more
big shots asking about possible pathways to work in aid related activities
in third-world countries... But future link ups would probably be with the
authors of books / articles / journals (normally they give email addresses)
I read and with people who may be interested in my learning projects... like
I'm reading up on building embedded linux systems now.. if i work on a small
project, I know of some people who may be interested... this linking up with
people is one of the goals that I am pushing for right now...

These are elaborations of a couple of parts in the brief summary.. Sorry for
the long email man... you must be busy with tutorials..But have fun with
them... Talk to you more on Friday!

Harish 

P.S. I'll be dropping by NUS next Wed for sure as I am going for the
lunchtime talk and this another one at 7pm.. I might drop by on some day
before that too.. I'll inform you when I come down!
