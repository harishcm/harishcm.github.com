<p class="P2">Below are perspectives on salary negotiation archived for future
reference. Several are readers&#8217; comments to the article &#8220;The Only Way to
Raise Your Salary&#8221; by Fred Kofman. Another is from a review to the book
&#8220;Linchpin: Are You Indispensable?&#8221; by Seth Godin.
</p>
<li class="L2">Bryan W. <ol>
<li class="L3">Data Architecture Consultant and Database Contractor
<p class="P3">&#8220;It is common (in the US) to hear business owners referred to a &#8220;job
creators&#8221;. With that point of reference, there are constant
pleadings to reduce the burden of government laws and regulations
and taxes on business &#8211; if we do, they say, then businesses will
&#8220;create jobs&#8221;. In truth, as this writer correctly points out,
businesses create profit, not jobs. They will create jobs only if
those jobs are necessary to create or increase profit. And, of
course, business will destroy jobs for exactly the same reason. The
value is not in the employment of you or anyone else. Indeed, since
your cost (as an employee or as an outside contractor) weighs
against profit, lowering your cost is the proper goal of a &#8220;rational
employer&#8221;. If I, the rational employer, can obtain increased
productivity from you, the employee, at your current pay rate, why
am I motivated to raise your pay (and thus reduce the value
contribution of your increased productivity)? Rationally, I would
thank you for your added value but resist paying you commensurately.
The key here for you, the employee, is to operate as if every action
you take is part of the negotiation &#8211; a negotiation focused not on
value but on cost. Your real or potential employer will negotiate
toward lowering the cost you impose on their business by your
presence. You will negotiate toward the cost the business will bear
if your are separated from the business.&#8221; </p>

<p class="P3">&#8220;The article reflects how things should be, but things are not
always like that. Mr Kofman quotes at a certain point a great
discovery in economy, i.e.: &#8220;value&#8221; is not an attribute of things
per se but, rather, an assessment made by the person for whom the
thing appears to be valuable. That is exactly the point. What counts
is not the value that the employee delivers to the employer, but the
value perceived by the employer. The perception is often very fuzzy,
and obviously the performance indicators can just give a support not
the entire picture. Concentrating on perceived value rather than on
actual value delivered changes obviously very much the priority
scale for the employee, and is one of the key reasons why many
successful managers change often their jobs: the shorter is the
period, the higher is the likely difference between perceived and
actual value, and the bigger the manipulation options are available
to the employee - the most common of which is the development of
short term &#8220;quick win&#8221; policies, cost-cut oriented, that deliver
strong results in the short term and weaken the infrastructure. The
prevalence of the perceived value is also one of the reasons why so
many overpaid incompetent CEOs are on top of important companies.
This seems to be a difficult problem to solve anyway, considering
how greedy the investors are and the level of pressure experienced
by most of the stock listed groups. The consultancy firms should
specialized in the assessment of the skills of the managers should
probably work on tools to assess not just the standard skills (like
target orientation, decision-making attitudes etc) but as well on
longer term oriented profile characteristics like capability to
pursue long term objectives, cultural flexibility, adaptatability,
communication skills at 360 degrees - i.e. with all levels of the
organization, from the very bottom to the very top, consistency,
etc. Finally, the salary decisions should not be just in the hands
of your own boss - but this is a different topic.&#8221; </p>

<p class="P3">&#8220;I think we&#8217;ve moved a bit fast here in dismissing the idea of labor
as value. For nothing of this economic scenario would be happening
without the labor that built (for ex.) the computers/&#8221;valuable
objects&#8221; on both sides. Neither proprietor would want, have, use,
buy or sell one without a fundamental sense of its value&#8212;i.e., the
further potential it can realize for him/her AS a powerful object
created by labor, by somebody&#8217;s fundamental work and toil. So in my
case as a Profit Mule (meaning an Adjunct college professor), the
proprietor can de-value my labor even though it makes the whole
school function in the first place: kids pay for my learning, not
for the school&#8217;s swell boss. This is based on the threat of getting
somebody else &#8220;about&#8221; as effective as I am at building school
results and reputation (and that&#8217;s another layer of profiteering,
churning out more and more teachers when there are scarcely any jobs
worth having). This de-valuing is really possible only because we&#8217;re
unprotected by full-time and/or tenure-track status&#8212;you notice
that those college profs make a very nice living. All this, finally,
is why Adjuncts are beginning to organize the value of their labor
(its effective power to create results in the world) into unions.
The value of the &#8220;thing&#8221; they create (education) is real and a
multiplier of both student and school potential and value. Oy,
unions? Well, what other mechanism is there to force these pure
profiteers to pay us more than even our present minimum wage? They
are contemptuous of every other approach. We&#8217;re looking forward to
the struggle&#8212;because the profiteers have so blatantly
over-extended themselves. We&#8217;re the majority of faculty now. We&#8217;re
the ones without whom the schools cannot function. Should be quite a
wake-up call.&#8221; </p>

<p class="P3">&#8220;When I started my own business, I realized that the best way to
raise my salary was to identify target customers with the most money
to spend. Though this sounds like an obvious strategy, I didn&#8217;t
realize it till I was in business for six months. I was so busy
creating a new business from scratch I wasn&#8217;t paying attention to
who my customers were, as I was just happy to have any work at all.
Now I&#8217;ve been able to target high income groups (think international
lawyers in Switzerland) and have been able to boost revenues
significantly.&#8221; </p>

<li class="L2">Luis R. <ol>
<li class="L3">ALWAYS OPEN TO NEW CHALLENGES
<p class="P3">&#8220;Great article, yet somewhat contradictory in itself: true you need
to increase the value you contribute in order to be able to ask for
more; yet if you can get your computer for free, or for $500 or for
$900 instead of $1,000 and you know it could do the same for you,
why pay the $1,000 instead of buying new? change can cost but&#8230;.new
computers bring new features (can&#8217;t teach old dogs new tricks) and
many companies hire fresh blood precisely to mould them better than
promoting veterans from within. Hence I&#8217;d say you add value to the
equation (true) then you become &#8220;indispensable&#8221; to the equation.
Becoming unique, specialized, ahead of the pack in state-of-art
knowledge and spearheading initiatives where your knowledge/training
becomes indispensable puts you ahead in the negotiation seat with
your employer when it&#8217;s time to &#8220;think aloud&#8221; about moving
companies. Then let the competition flirt with you and see how your
employer will offer the raise before you ask. Complementing the
article, is not just about more value, but about a &#8220;Unique Value
Proposition&#8221;, as in Blue Ocean Strategy.&#8221; </p>

<p class="P3">&#8220;Von Mises&#8217; classical economics works very well if people can be
modeled as automatons, seeking maximum economic value absent any
emotion. Human reality is that most job decisions have a large
component of emotion - employers are more concerned about
organizational fit than pure performance, and employees are
concerned about working in a place where they will be respected and
work among agreeable colleagues. As I&#8217;ve learned from the wisdom of
the HRM&#8217;s in my network (as well as my own experience), the most
common reason good employees choose to leave is not for higher pay,
but for greater respect and opportunity. Top employees will usually
tolerate slightly sub-par pay if all the other job factors are
positive.&#8221; </p>

<p class="P3">&#8220;Strictly rational economics fail in the real world. An employer may
not recognize your extra productivity, they may not even understand
what you do (as is often the case in technical fields), they may
recognize it but still decide to keep your pay no higher than what
they believe you can get elsewhere. Employers chronically
underestimate the costs of retraining and the tacit knowledge their
employees possess. (a) Grow your network inside and outside of work,
(b) diversifying your skills and keep them up-to-date, &copy; do what
you do with passion, (d) don&#8217;t let yourself get stuck in a situation
where you can&#8217;t walk away (i.e. with a huge mortgage), and (e) trust
and be trusted.&#8221; </p>

<p class="P3">&#8220;Great article in concept, but the challenge is when your employer
will not give you the autonomy to make any change for the better.
How then, if you are forced to work within the &#8220;status quo&#8221; can you
expect to improve your outcome and ultimately, drive more value? I
believe in &#8220;work smarter, not harder.&#8221; Would love to hear your
thoughts on practical application.&#8221; </p>

<p class="P3">&#8220;Maybe true in small or medium outfits. In larger organization, one
has to network. And I don&#8217;t mean networking with your peers. You
cannot be a poor performer. But at some point, one would realize
it&#8217;s not hard working or talent that would get them very far career
wise. It&#8217;s a sad truth. If you have skills and are unable to get
ahead, shop around for a better place to contribute. That&#8217;s the only
way to get a raise.&#8221; </p>

<p class="P3">&#8220;It&#8217;s very expensive to have rational employer in this world. The
organizational culture and politics determine the employers decision
to pay an employee. Other issue to consider is discrimination issue.
In Indonesia, for instance, expatriates get higher salary compared
to their Indonesian fellows for the same level of position or
expertise in many cases. How can we relate it to rational decision
making of the employers?&#8221; </p>

<p class="P3">&#8220;Well we all know todays modern workforce encompasses Socialist
ideology anyway. People seem to want to spend more time enjoying
their job and having others help them enjoy it and for some stupid
reason they are happy to allow bosses to underpay them. Whats the
point of providing value in this situation ?? You do a great job and
get a salary, the person next to you gets drunk, is untidy,
hungover, and gets the exact same salary you do. So point being ??&#8221; </p>

<p class="P3">&#8220;Thought provoking but while determining value add to your
employer&#8217;s customers is difficult to determine and the rational
answer, it is too rational and not nearly complex enough to fit the
world most of us work in. As some of the other posts have indicated,
almost the only value that matters is the value your employer sees,
whether the value is logical or not. Moreover, value to an employer
in a large organization may have little to do with the
organization&#8217;s customers but much more to the your value to your
employer in supporting her fights within the organization. There are
also high transaction costs in finding and replacing employees with
others that theoretically could provide better value at less cost as
well as less rational factors such as replacing one or more of your
direct reports with much less experienced persons that may in turn
raise concerns that the employer herself is overqualified. For some
employers, a subordinate who better satisfies the boss&#8217;s customers
is a competitive threat, not someone who warrants a raise. Bottom
line to me is that the value your employer thinks you have will
determine your ability to get that raise. In the best case adding
value for your employer&#8217;s customers would be the most important
criteria. In most cases it will be ensuring your actions are seen as
supporting goals that your employer seeks, making him look good and
feel secure.&#8221; </p>

<p class="P3">&#8220;The old adage, &#8220;it&#8217;s not what you know, but who you know&#8221; is key
for obtaining higher roles of responsibilities that command higher
salaries. To that end, relationship management is paramount for
individual financial growth in the workplace. In a perfect world,
the person who knew the most, or did the most work, would earn the
most money. Not everyone sells widgets for their employer so it can
be difficult to determine how much value an individual can add to
the bottom line. As referenced from Dale Carnegie&#8217;s book How to Win
Friends and Influence People, developing friendships by persuading
people to like you can sway them to your way of thinking and provide
you that better job when the opportunity comes along. Heck, if you
do it well enough, maybe the leader/president/CEO might create a
role along with a higher salary just for you. We all know that this
does happen more times than we care to admit.&#8221; </p>

<li class="L2">This is a review to the book &#8220;Linchpin: Are You Indispensable?&#8221; by Seth Godin <ol>
<li class="L3">Wow, severe generalizations abound April 9, 2010
<li class="L3">BY Rumi
<p class="P3">(This a a re-post of a comment I made on another forum that is not
likely to be seen by anyone else. Since it essentially boils down to
a review, I&#8217;m going to post it here instead of writing another
one.).
<strike></strike><strike></strike><strike></strike>&#8212;
I&#8217;m reading this book now and &#8220;losing my mind&#8221; trying to see Seth&#8217;s
point of view. I inhabit the world of the cogs (and I indeed did not
plan to end up here and I do not want to turn my brain off at work)
so I know for a fact that several of the assumptions that he&#8217;s
basing his theories on are wrong. I also noted how the book
conveniently mentioned the lizard brain as a judgment to foist upon
those of us who disagreed with his premise. I will not accept that
judgment.
</p>
<p class="P3">
Not all companies value linchpins and creative thinkers. To some,
they are just troublemakers. Also, my job and many other cogs may be
*defined* as unskilled, but the reality can far different. Is it as
skilled as that of an architect or engineer? Of course not. But to
imply that those jobs are the new norm/middle ground and broadly
define those of us below that level (at jobs that *used* to be
considered professional) as unskilled, stings. And I refuse to wear
that label. We live in a world where our university economies have
been pumping out masters degree graduates and Ph.Ds doing endless
postdocs, while most of our new jobs are in the service sector. It&#8217;s
my belief that underemployment is mostly a structural problem, not a
personal one that points to lack of creativity, initiative, or
energy on my part (plus living in MS and being obligated to stay
here doesn&#8217;t help&#8230; but this is another common problem for the
cogs; lack of money and responsibilities to family usually prevent
them from fleeing to other states or cities where they can practice
their talents)
</p>
<p class="P3">
I&#8217;ve only gotten about 1/3 through the book so far. I&#8217;m going to
hope that his message gets a little easier to swallow or that at
least he no longer insults people like myself. The audience of this
book is definitely not people like me. I see it as upper middle
class/white collar pablum to appeal to people who have little
experience with being poor and being stuck being a cog. To me, only
people who have never really been smacked down by illogic and
outright theft of their ideas, money and future can say things like
you&#8217;re stuck being a cog because you *won&#8217;t* change. (for example, I
see students at the university I work at who literally have their
parents *steal* their money from their checking accounts and
savings, open up credit lines in their names and ruin their credit
&#8211; sometimes before they ever even get to college.) Changing your
life requires at least some measure of resources to do so. Stating
that we *all* can do it if we want to&#8230;baloney. No such thing as
&#8220;can&#8217;t&#8221; may hold true for a percentage of society, but that doesn&#8217;t
mean that it really doesn&#8217;t exist. One-hundred and fifty years ago,
try saying &#8220;no such thing as can&#8217;t&#8221; to a slave. Their lot in life
changed not from being all &#8220;engaged&#8221; with their work. It came from
the &#8220;uppity&#8221; ones that fought back, escaped, and the white
abolishionists. It came from a president that refused to allow the
country to participate in forcing a populous to be property. And
later it came from another president who sent armed troops into
Mississippi to demand that the state follow the laws of the land.
</p>
<p class="P3">
I have no problem with the personal message to completely engage
yourself in everything that you do. Giving with no expectation of
being noticed or rewarded is the only way to go. So, on a personal
level, be courageous and give your job and anything you do your
full attention and go the extra mile. But the reality is that most
people will take advantage of you, your job excellence will
redefine the expectations of your position to a new higher standard
and you and others will be judged more harshly. Clueless managers
will likely not know how valuable you are so they&#8217;ll lay you off
with equal frequency as all the non-linchpins. (Unless you spend
time in self promotion and schmoozing around your company which
would seem to be the opposite of being a linchpin to me).
</p>
<p class="P3">
This review is by a cog, who lives in a world that no matter how
creatively you work and how much involvement you try to get in your
job, your management will not let you participate because you don&#8217;t
have the purchased credentials of a masters degree. You will be
left out of meetings, your ideas will be ignored, creativity
frustrates them because you&#8217;re acting uppity, and you have no hope
of promotion no matter what you do. This is my reality. I still
engage fully with my job even though it bores me to tears. I still
try to be creative and think of things we could do better, but I
have to find a &#8220;higher up&#8221; to sponsor them.
</p>
<p class="P3">
To sum it up, on a personal level, I thought Seth&#8217;s ideas were spot
on. A no-brainer, but worded in an engaging and positive manner.
But equating them to becoming indispensable and less likely to be
laid off in the corporate world was a stretch; one I just couldn&#8217;t
make. There&#8217;s an old saying&#8230;something like, the graveyard is full
of indispensable men. Ultimately, no one is indispensable. The
irony is that we are all remarkable snowflakes; beautiful in our
individuality, but all utterly replaceable no matter how far up the
food chain you rise. For us cogs, that point is driven home very
early in life. I also resented what appeared to be an assumption by
the book that those stuck in cog jobs were resistant to change, not
engaged in their work, or unskilled. Saying that there&#8217;s no such
thing as &#8220;can&#8217;t change&#8221; is akin to blaming a hostage that they
can&#8217;t free themselves from their imprisonment. Sure, some people
wouldn&#8217;t run if you killed the criminal, opened all the doors and
laid out a red carpet and flashing neon directional signs. But most
folks&#8230;just give &#8216;em a little wiggle room and they will indeed
rise to the occasion. Ultimately, there is nothing wrong that we
live in a world where we are not all Nelson Mandelas. </ol>
