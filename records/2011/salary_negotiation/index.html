<ol>
<li class="L1">Inspiration <ol>
<p class="P2">It looks like the most important things in salary negotiations are
information and preparation.
</p>
<p class="P2">
I&#8217;m taking the perspective that it is possible to ask for any salary (or
salary increase), as long as it is within the budget of the employer,
or if not within the budget, within the limits of additional funds or
sources of funding that can be appropriated.
</p>
<p class="P2">
One could pick any number and substantiate it with one or more lines of
reasoning, as long as it is as objective as possible, and supported by
facts and relevant data.
</p>
<p class="P2">
Perhaps it is very much like constructing an argument (claim +
reasoning), but it also involves the human aspects greatly as well. </p>

<li class="L2">Comparative Employment Offers Track
<li class="L2">Value of the Work I Have Done Track <ol>
<p class="P3">Let my supervisor give a value for how much I should be paid for the
work that I have done. Ask him/her to pay me what she thinks I am
worth. If she does not have the budget, substitute the reduced
payment for other perks.
</p>
<li class="L3">Possible Perks <ol>
<li class="L4">What do I want? </ol>
<li class="L3">Question to supervisor <ol>
<li class="L4">What do you think I am worth? </ol>
<li class="L3">Comments <ol>
<p class="P4">This might be a good methodology, as I do not throw out a number
at the beginning. I also let my supervisor speak as much as
possible, and understand her side of the story, before telling
her mine. There is also a chance that my supervisor may put
forward a number of my worth that is greater than what I
expected him/her to. It would be less adversarial as well. Also,
if I do get a higher salary offer elsewhere, it is likely there
would be no hard feelings, as I would be maximizing returns to
both myself and to the other party as well. </p>

<li class="L3">BY Fred Kofman
<li class="L3">Online Opinion Article, Accessed July 2013

<li class="L3">Initial Perception 2013-07 <ol>
<p class="P4">I felt that the article raised at least a couple of
interesting perspectives, but the real gems, I felt, were

<li class="L2">In the Name of Love <ol>
<li class="L3">BY Miya Tokumitsu
<li class="L3">Online Article, Accessed March 2014
<li class="L3"><a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2014/01/do_what_you_love_love_what_you_do_an_omnipresent_mantra_that_s_bad_for_work.html">URL 1</a>
<li class="L3"><a href="https://www.jacobinmag.com/2014/01/in-the-name-of-love/">URL 2</a>
<li class="L3">Initial Perception 2014-03-24 <ol>
<p class="P4">A different take on the &#8220;do what you love mantra&#8221; which
appears to be popular in career advice to students and
youngsters today.
</p>
<p class="P4">
Miya Tokumitsu points out danger zones and ill effects
surrounding this mantra, especially to people forced to do
unlovable but socially necessary work for a living&#8212;they
stand to get devalued, dehumanised, and their contributions
&#8220;banished from the spectrum of consciousness altogether&#8221;.
</p>
<p class="P4">
Tokumitsu also cites examples of devastating effects of
the mantra even on work which is intellectually or socially
desirable, such as academic careers, fashion, media and the
arts&#8212;with poorly paid PhD holders and adjunct faculty, and
upaid interns forming a large part of their respective
workforces. An ideology that workers are &#8220;doing it for love&#8221;
encourages exploitation, even in intellectually and socially
desirable work.
</p>
<p class="P4">
The article also discusses the exclusion of people who need
to work for wages from entire professions or
industries&#8212;effectively stripping these professions and
industries of the diversity found in society, and resulting
in work being divided along class lines.
</p>
<p class="P4">
The article ends with pointing out that effects of &#8220;do what
you love&#8221; affects women more than men, and that it is an
ideology that is well suited in masking exploitative
mechanisms present in capitalism.
</p>
<p class="P4">
A thought-provoking read which I have am still trying to
internalise, especially with regards to the ramifications. </p>

<li class="L2">Gratuity payments in NUS to foreigners <ol>
<p class="P3">Include that into calculation </p>
</ol>
<li class="L2">Additional payment to foreigners in-lieu of employer CPF component <ol>
<p class="P3">Include differential into calculation </p>
</ol>
<li class="L2">Employment Pass requirements <ol>
<p class="P3">Minimum Basic Salary is fixed at $3000. This is the minimum baseline
from which other criteria are to be taken into account. Probably
keep this in case negotiations turn to something like &#8220;I can pay
Bachelor&#8217;s Degree holders less than $3000&#8221;. You can bring in
frames such as &#8220;illegal&#8221; if really necessary. But this is of
course at the extreme. It is much more productive to negotiate in
terms of other factors, perhaps talent or productivity. </p>
</ol>
<li class="L2">Bonus payments in-lieu <ol>
<p class="P3">E.g. Additional renumeration for my performance. </p>
</ol>
</ol>
<li class="L1">Mindset <ol>
<li class="L2">Strong objective data and information to support my case <ol>
<p class="P3">I have to give my manager sufficient information to substantiate her
decision to her supervisors and to the university. </p>
</ol>
<li class="L2">Listen to concerns of my manager <ol>
<p class="P3">While my manger may wish to pay me more, she would be be limited by
factors such as funding, differential of salary between her other
staff/employees and skill at substantiating the salary to her
colleagues and supervisors. </p>
</ol>
</ol>
<li class="L1">Questions <ol>
<li class="L2">What are the frames I should adopt during negotiations? <ol>
<p class="P3">What is the overarching theme or concept I should put across during
the negotiations? Different frames for different situations?
</p>
<li class="L3">Possible frames <ol>
<li class="L4">This is not a world class lab <ol>
<p class="P5">I don&#8217;t like this frame as it is negative, but it is a
start. </p>
</ol>
<li class="L4">Long term career <ol>
<p class="P5">This is probably not a good frame, as I&#8217;m not looking for
this with my current manager. </p>
</ol>
</ol>
</ol>
<li class="L2">What is the underlying personality of the manager?
<li class="L2">What are the salary limits? <ol>
<p class="P3">For example, it may be difficult to justify paying me more than a
PhD holder. However, I could turn that around and ask why is there
such a large differential between Assistant Professors and Research
Fellows. </p>
</ol>
<li class="L2">What is the figure for my proposed/expected salary?
<li class="L2">Can I get other benefits instead, if my salary cannot be at a level that satisfies me?
<li class="L2">What is the limit for which budget is currently available? </ol>
</ol>
