<li class="L4">Initial Perception 2014-03-24 <ol>
<p class="P5">A different take on the &#8220;do what you love mantra&#8221; which
appears to be popular in career advice to students and
youngsters today.
</p>
<p class="P5">
Miya Tokumitsu points out danger zones and ill effects
surrounding this mantra, especially to people forced to do
unlovable but socially necessary work for a living&#8212;they
stand to get devalued, dehumanised, and their contributions
&#8220;banished from the spectrum of consciousness altogether&#8221;.
</p>
<p class="P5">
Tokumitsu also cites examples of devastating effects of
the mantra even on work which is intellectually or socially
desirable, such as academic careers, fashion, media and the
arts&#8212;with poorly paid PhD holders and adjunct faculty, and
upaid interns forming a large part of their respective
workforces. An ideology that workers are &#8220;doing it for love&#8221;
encourages exploitation, even in intellectually and socially
desirable work.
</p>
<p class="P5">
The article also discusses the exclusion of people who need
to work for wages from entire professions or
industries&#8212;effectively stripping these professions and
industries of the diversity found in society, and resulting
in work being divided along class lines.
</p>
<p class="P5">
The article ends with pointing out that effects of &#8220;do what
you love&#8221; affects women more than men, and that it is an
ideology that is well suited in masking exploitative
mechanisms present in capitalism.
</p>
<p class="P5">
A thought-provoking read which I have am still trying to
internalise, especially with regards to the ramifications. </p>

<li class="L4">Initial Perception 2013-07 <ol>
<p class="P5">I felt that the article raised at least a couple of
interesting perspectives, but the real gems, I felt, were
embedded within the readers&#8217; comments. Selected comments
have been archived in <a href="../perspectives/">Perspectives</a>. </p>

<li class="L2">Added Possible Plan <ol>
<li class="L3">Value of the Work I Have Done Track <ol>
<p class="P4">Let my supervisor give a value for how much I should be paid for the
work that I have done. Ask him/her to pay me what she thinks I am
worth. If she does not have the budget, substitute the reduced
payment for other perks.
</p>
<li class="L4">Possible Perks <ol>
<li class="L5">What do I want? </ol>
<li class="L4">Question to supervisor <ol>
<li class="L5">What do you think I am worth? </ol>
<li class="L4">Comments <ol>
<p class="P5">This might be a good methodology, as I do not throw out a number
at the beginning. I also let my supervisor speak as much as
possible, and understand her side of the story, before telling
her mine. There is also a chance that my supervisor may put
forward a number of my worth that is greater than what I
expected him/her to. It would be less adversarial as well. Also,
if I do get a higher salary offer elsewhere, it is likely there
would be no hard feelings, as I would be maximizing returns to
both myself and to the other party as well. </p>

<li class="L2">Created Initial Outline
<li class="L2">Thought <ol>
<p class="P3">Statistical tables showing mean, median, quartile and wage bands
would be useful only for starting salaries, and for setting the
minimum bar for salaries. I however, want to to go beyond, and look
for data and information on other aspects which determine or
influence differences in wages. This information would be useful to
negotiate for increased wages, or for wages at the higher ends of
the wage band. </ol>
