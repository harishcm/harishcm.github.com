<p>Singapore General Election 2011 (GE2011) was termed a watershed election, that eventually saw the People&#8217;s Action Party (PAP) being returned to power with 93% of seats in parliament, a reduction from 97% of seats previously. The PAP however, managed to garner only 60% of the overall number of votes, a reduction from 67% previously. More significantly, a hurdle, previously thought insurmountable by an opposition party&#8212;capturing a Group Representation Constituency (GRC)&#8212;was overcome by the Workers Party (WP), through its capture of Aljunied GRC by a margin of 9%.</p>

<p>In GE2011, the WP showed what it takes to win a GRC. It also performed well in its other contested constituencies, recapturing Hougang Single Member Constituency (SMC) with a larger margin than previously. Looking at the results, it could be said that its brand name commanded an average of at least 45% of the vote in the constituencies it was contesting in. With the additional resources from Aljunied GRC, and synergy with Hougang SMC, the WP may be able to establish a stronghold for future elections. Still, the WP has a lot to prove in the coming 5 years, but is probably well poised to do, with its 6 elected seats in parliament, and additional (though non-voting) seats occupied by Yee Jenn Jong of Joo Chiat, and possibly another candidate, through the Non-Constituency Member of Parliament (NCMP) scheme.</p>

<p>The PAP, despite losing a GRC, still commands more than 2/3 of the seats in parliament, and at least on paper, can pretty much do whatever it wants, both to the constitution and to all other laws in Singapore. It however saw its share of the vote in several GRCs dip to the 50s, in terms of percentage. The PAP thus knows that if it does not improve, become more compassionate, listen to the electorate, and apologise when it makes mistakes, it may be severely hurt by the GRC system in future elections. Whether the PAP makes significant strides in the above matters remains to be seen, but it is likely that the PAP will reduce GRC sizes in GE 2016, motivated in part to reduce further possible losses.</p>

<p>Lina Chiam of the Singapore People&#8217;s Party (SPP) has an opportunity to prove herself as an NCMP, and if she does well, things may pick up for SPP. Still, Potong Pasir SMC (SPP&#8217;s previous stronghold) may no longer exist in GE 2016, and it is an uphill battle for the SPP. The SPP has to also focus on leadership renewal if it wishes to move beyond the personality factor of Chiam See Tong in its future electoral contests.</p>

<p>The National Solidarity Party (NSP) spread out its &#8216;A&#8217; candidates into several GRCs. It was perhaps this strategy that has caused the NSP to perform below its own expectations. It is clear though, that the NSP needs to improve its branding, in order to be able to perform better. Also, since the strategy of capturing a GRC is now out of the box, a single GRC team consisting of heavyweights such as Nicole Seah, Tony Tan, Hazel Poa, Goh Meng Seng, Jeanette Chong-Aruldoss, if they consolidate and start walking the ground over the next few years, is likely pack a punch in GE2016.</p>

<p>The Singapore Democratic Party (SDP) would have been a phoenix rising from the ashes if the fight in Holland-Bukit Timah had been close. Unfortunately, the results for Holland-Bukit Timah GRC indicate that Singaporeans are probably not yet ready for what the SDP stands for at a fundamental level&#8212;democratic ideals, absolute human rights and non-discrimination against anybody, irregardless of who/what they are. The party has however started to address the more bread-and-butter issues, by issuing a Shadow Budget, largely by Vincent Wijeysingha, a plan for rejuvenating Singapore, by Tan Jee Say, and a Shadow Health Plan, in consultation with medical professionals. It also has been working on its branding and outreach, albeit largely on the internet, due to the continued lack of support from the mainstream media. The SDP however has to go into details of implementation when presenting their documents, especially with their Health Plan. Doing so would put further pressure on the media to report on the SDP&#8217;s plans more favourably. We may be in for big surprises from the SDP in future years as it is a party that dreams big. SDP&#8217;s Secretary-General Chee Soon Juan hinted, after results were confirmed, that &#8220;This is just the beginning.&#8221;</p>

<p>For the Reform Party (RP), GE2011 provided its first electoral battles. In an interesting move, RP and SPP combined members and resources so as to stand in Ang Mo Kio GRC, with the team being lead by Alex Tan Zhixiang, who managed to raise the required election deposit within a few days. RP&#8217;s Secretary-General, Kenneth Jeyaretnam, is probably an intelligent man, and has shown that he can attract top talents, but has to work on his people and leadership skills to be able to keep them. His people and leadership skills will play a huge part in determining the future of the party.</p>

<p>The Singapore Democratic Alliance (SDA) was arguably the weakest opposition party in GE2011. Harminder Pal Singh and his team in Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC had their hearts in the right places, but have to better engage with residents in the future if they wish to garner more votes. The SDA&#8217;s loss of election deposit in Sengkang West SMC sends out a strong message to the weaker opposition parties to avoid 3-cornered fights, at all costs.</p>

<p>Looking from a larger social perspective, GE2011 witnessed the social/alternative media becoming part of the mainstream of Singapore&#8217;s political discourse. Political discourse on social/alternative media put to naught previous concerns that the young are apathetic to local politics. Still, together with the results of the general elections, it also showed that there was a sizable number of swing voters, who probably form the majority, and may be the most important part of the electorate to reach out to in future elections.</p>

<p>Great strides were made by the opposition parties and MARUAH in spreading the message that one&#8217;s vote is secret. Still, it likely that a significant part of the population continues to be afraid that their vote &#8217;will&#8217; be traced, and that severe consequences would befall upon them once that happens&#8212;a fantasy illusion, but a strong one that grips them in fear nonetheless. Part of community outreach by civil society, and part walking the ground for opposition parties, would be to bring across this message to more people, especially those not connected to the internet or those unable to attend election rallies.</p>

<p>In all, GE2011 was an exciting one, and probably a watershed one, that saw the capture of a GRC by an opposition party, a significant reduction in the overall percentage of votes obtained by the ruling party, the establishment of social/alternative media as part of the mainstream for political discourse, a better idea of the electorate in terms of desire for political engagement and voting behaviour, and a significant increase in awareness that one&#8217;s vote is secret. It will probably be remembered for years to come.</p>
