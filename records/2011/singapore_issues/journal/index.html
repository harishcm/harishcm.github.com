<li class="L3">Riot in Little India - What could happen next: Considerations and Consequences
<li class="L3">BY mjuse
<li class="L3"><a href="http://flaneurose.blogspot.sg/2013/12/riot-in-little-india-what-could-happen.html">URL</a>
<li class="L3">My Comment <ol>
<p class="P4">Hi Melbourne, you have pretty much brushed away the just and
reasonable concern that abuses faced by migrant workers in
Singapore are excessive.
</p>
<p class="P4">
The abuses are common, and indeed excessive when compared to
reasonable international standards, such as with conditions of
migrant workers in similar occupations in other highly
industrialised nations.
</p>
<p class="P4">
Let&#8217;s not lower our bar any lower than that, shall we?
</p>
<p class="P4">
Unfortunately, most of these abuses don&#8217;t make the news, which
is pretty unsurprising, as in Singapore&#8217;s employment climate,
even payslips are not mandatory. Let&#8217;s not even get started
about wage levels, working and living conditions, kickbacks and
deductions, lack of training, etc..
</p>
<p class="P4">
Well, unscrupulous employers aren&#8217;t stupid to leave a paper
trail, and the current laws pretty much facilitate them in doing
so.
</p>
<p class="P4">
How do you know, beyond the seemingly anecdotal, if there are no
records?
</p>
<p class="P4">
If there&#8217;s a feeling that there is not enough public information
of the abuses that do indeed occur, the above is a start in
seeking for more answers.
</p>
<p class="P4">
Singapore is no Australia (just a metaphor) when it comes to
workers rights. </p>

<li class="L3">The Little India riot aftermath - let&#8217;s talk about solutions
<li class="L3">BY LIFT
<li class="L3"><a href="http://limpehft.blogspot.sg/2013/12/the-little-india-riot-aftermath-lets.html">URL</a>
<li class="L3">My Comment <ol>
<p class="P4">Hi LIFT, I work in the construction industry, and it is a common
experience that workers are made to work till 5pm on Sundays.
</p>
<p class="P4">
It is only after 5pm that they can return to their dormitories
to bathe and change, and then head to Little India or other
recreational areas. Sadly, this is the only time each week that
they get some &#8220;time off&#8221;.
</p>
<p class="P4">
As part of tackling this issue, we probably need to make it
mandatory for all workers to be granted at least one day off
each week.
</p>
<p class="P4">
This is first and foremost, from a rights perspective&#8212;being
human like us, they too need rest and recreation. Hopefully this
would translate into more overtime pay for them as well, but
that is an issue for another day.
</p>
<p class="P4">
With a mandatory day off, places like Little India will become
less crowded on Sunday nights. Workers can choose to arrive and
depart at any time on Sunday, instead of only after 5pm. The
peak period is thus attenuated. Also, with more time on their
hands, workers could plan trips to other recreational places as
well, further reducing the Sunday night congestion in Little
India.
</p>
<p class="P4">
Of course, travel behaviour is complex, and the possibilities
need to be studied in greater detail. Still, the idea is
probably worth pushing for, if not for altruistic
reasons&#8212;which have found slow success in
Singapore&#8212;for pragmatic ones at least. </p>

<li class="L3">Human Trafficking and Shadow Boxing
<li class="L3">BY Alex Au
<li class="L3"><a href="http://yawningbread.wordpress.com/2013/09/22/human-trafficking-and-shadow-boxing/">URL</a>
<li class="L3">My Comment <ol>
<p class="P4">Hi Automaton,
</p>
<p class="P4">
Thank you for your reply and for your link to Mr Leong’s
article.
</p>
<p class="P4">
I too believe, as per Mr Leong’s analysis, that construction
costs are only about 40% of the prices of HDB BTO flats.
</p>
<p class="P4">
Labour costs of workers however, are very much lower:
</p>
<p class="P4">
Typical wages of general workers are $18/day (8am-7pm)&#8212;before
deductions. I believe, with overtime, additional wages for
foremen and supervisors, effective wages paid would be in the
range of $20 to $30/day (will be glad if anyone could advise
better).
</p>
<p class="P4">
Doing a simple sensitivity analysis (see note below for
assumptions):
</p>
<p class="P4">
• Labour $20/day: 4% of BTO flat price (10% of construction
costs)
</p>
<p class="P4">
• Labour $25/day: 5% of BTO flat price (12.5% of construction
costs)
</p>
<p class="P4">
• Labour $30/day: 6% of BTO flat price (15% of construction
costs)
</p>
<p class="P4">
• Labour $40/day: 8% of BTO flat price (20% of construction
costs)
</p>
<p class="P4">
• Labour $50/day: 10% of BTO flat price (25% of construction
costs)
</p>
<p class="P4">
• Labour $60/day: 12% of BTO flat price (30% of construction
costs)
</p>
<p class="P4">
• Comparative cost of levies @ $10-$15/day: 2&#8211;3% of BTO flat
price (5-7.5% of construction costs)
</p>
<p class="P4">
Note: Labour costs are assuming
</p>
<p class="P4">
• a $200 million dollar project&#8212;say 15 blocks (15-storey) with
2 carparks
</p>
<p class="P4">
• 500 workers (typical peak worker count for project of this
size)
</p>
<p class="P4">
• for 750 days (about 2 years)
</p>
<p class="P4">
Reiterating, labour costs make up a very small percentage of the
price of a HDB BTO flat&#8212;in the mid single digits. You can
extrapolate for resale and private properties.
</p>
<p class="P4">
The truth is trafficking-like employment practices isn’t going
to bring down housing prices by a single cent.
</p>
<p class="P4">
Instead, as in my previous post:
</p>
<p class="P4">
• The bosses cream the profits [because there are so many
workers]
</p>
<p class="P4">
• The government makes the levies [again, because there are so
many workers, but a poorer bargain I should say&#8212;which is why
I believe the bosses are somehow very influential]
</p>
<p class="P4">
• But for you and I, construction <a href="or">more so&#8212;labour</a> costs
have very little to do with we pay at the end of the day </p>

<li class="L3">My Comment <ol>
<p class="P4">Thanks for the link, Alex. Wow that’s some detailed
investigations.
</p>
<p class="P4">
It’s so sad. Thousands of young people seeking opportunities to
make a better life by upgrading themselves. And some Singaporean
entities seeking to exploit their eagerness at every nook and
cranny possible.
</p>
<p class="P4">
I guess it provides a window into the true nature of an
influential section of Singapore society – influential, as
somehow it seems that our government is hesitant to oppose their
ways.
</p>
<p class="P4">
Perhaps a name and shame campaign of developers/developments in
SG would make things better? I mean like condos are meant to be
luxuries: Anyone up for “Lush Villas, TOP: XX/XX/XX”? &#8212;
Discounts made possible through the trafficking-like
exploitation of its constructors. </p>

<p class="P4">Automaton, you are wrong&#8212;it doesn’t work that way.
</p>
<p class="P4">
The bosses cream the profits. The government makes the levies.
But for you and I, construction costs have very little to do
with we pay at the end of the day&#8212;just ask the HDB.
</p>
<p class="P4">
The truth is: paying workers more simply means that less workers
being employed to do the same amount of work&#8212;increased labour
productivity. The contractors know how to make it happen.
Machinery is one thing. But there is so much more, such as
organisational structures, training and work processes.
</p>
<p class="P4">
Change is not too difficult. It just needs us to put in place
the right carrots and sticks. And uplifting the downtrodden;
don&#8217;t you want to be a do-gooder? </p>

<li class="L4">Perspective 2012-09-24 <ol>
<p class="P5">A glimpse into parts of Singapore in the 1930s. It was
amazing&#8212;the beauty of the architecture and the developed state
of the roads and amenities. While only a small proportion of the
population was able to make full use of them, it showcases the
high degree of development that had already occurred in Singapore
during the earlier part of the 20th century. </p>
</ol>
<li class="L4">Thought 2012-09-24 <ol>
<p class="P5">I had seen this short film several months before, but kept
thinking that the film couldn&#8217;t have been made in the 1930s.
I kept thinking that the date was faked in some way. It was
only upon viewing it again, and looking at the imagery at a
deeper level, that I began to feel that it may actually be
truly filmed in the 1930s.
</p>
<p class="P5">
It is interesting that I had this mental model of a
&#8220;backward&#8221; Singapore in the 1930s. Obviously, a large part
had to do with our history textbooks in school, but
something makes me feel that this is a lot deeper than that.
It is something that is not confined to Singapore alone, but
something that can shed light upon the ways in which we
think about our forefathers, the past, and about history
itself. </p>
