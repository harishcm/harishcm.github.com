<pre>The proof doesn't follow if the axiom is false.
30 ஏப்ரல் 2011, 03:21 க்கு Hongwan Liuஆல்

From reading pro-PAP writing, or even just regular non-partisan comments online,  I have noticed something disturbing going on. Singaporeans appear to have already internalised some of the very assumptions that are being challenged at this election. The PAP has every right to convince us of the truth of these ideas, but it's amazing to see how effective their rhetoric has been.
 
One of the more universally accepted, unquestioned arguments goes like this: 
 
Opposition isn't capable enough ---&gt; They'll suck in parliament ---&gt; Don't vote them in, vote PAP. 
 
This works on two levels: on the constituency level, and on the national level. I think on the constituency level, this argument is difficult to defend. I can hardly believe that both Mr. Chiam See Tong and Mr. Low Thia Khiang have been consistently voted in without doing a good job, and I'm sure that candidates like Sylvia Lim would be excellent on the constituency level. Minister George Yeo's challenge to the opposition to detail their plan for Aljunied GRC felt slightly unfair, because none of the opposition candidates can guarantee ANY positive changes that they can make to the constituency. We know for a fact that they will be denied both money and the means for pretty much any plan that has to go through parliament. Rather than make empty promises, they would rather make none. 
 
On the national level, I think the credentials and the passion of the best opposition candidates this time can hardly be questioned. The only thing left to support this argument is their lack of any major policy proposals. I think this too is slightly inaccurate: Ms. Sylvia Lim has raised tons of objections and alternatives to all kinds of policy changes in parliament (ministerial pay, NCMP scheme, GRCs etc.), and I've at least seen Mr. Chiam in one video give his thoughts on CPF. The SDP's stand on human rights is already an indication of the motions they will pursue in parliament: I know, for example, that one of their long-term goals is the abolition the ISA, even if they haven't explicitly mentioned it. They have also asked for GST to be lifted for basic goods, among other economic proposals.
 
Whether or not these proposals are good, they have definitely been making them. But maybe this is all still insufficient for voters. They want more policies, more concrete ideas. Sadly, this is what I think is happening: 
 
Don't vote the opposition in, vote PAP ---&gt; Opposition not voted in ---&gt; Opposition has no experience in policy making and the workings of ministries ---&gt; They cannot make concrete proposals on policy during the election ---&gt; Don't vote them in, vote PAP
 
I don't expect anyone who has never been in parliament to be able to make any detailed changes to policy, especially economic, defense or foreign policy, and certainly any party's policy will never match the PAP's on any level: their dominance in government has kept everyone else out of the inner plumbings of governance. Opposition parties therefore can't make any proposals because they're too weak. And they are weak because the electorate has kept them weak. It's a vicious cycle that the PAP fully exploits, convincing even those who want alternative voices in parliament to continue to reject opposition parties. But perhaps those who want to see a strong alternative voice in parliament need to begin by voting the opposition in first. 
 
The other argument that people accept without question is this: 
 
Everything is basically great in this country ---&gt; The PAP should take all the credit for that ---&gt; Vote the PAP
 
While the PAP should take some credit, I think the prevalence of this argument is sad, but not surprising. Singaporeans are very rarely praised, if ever, by the mainstream media, and I think we've gotten used to it. The PAP rally at Punggol (or Sengkang?) praised the PA, the grassroots leaders, the supporters, but not the constituency, and definitely not the citizens of Singapore. It's curious how we don't ever give ourselves credit for being hardworking, no-nonsense, terribly efficient and free from corruption. I think as a country we now have the right ingredients to do things well, and I don't think the very best opposition candidates will weaken that. None of the qualities that I listed are PAP qualities alone, and I think the WP, for example, will certainly expect the same high standard in the civil service if they were leading the country. The only difference here is one of policy, which reduces to the previous point. 
 
The last argument I'm going to mention here, which creeps up even in letters like this one http://www.pap.org.sg/articleview.php?id=8200&amp;mode&amp;cid=23&amp;preview=1, is one of the most illogical ones around: 
 
Multi-party politics ---&gt; Unstable country ---&gt; Don't vote opposition
 
Somewhere along the way we have come to conflate instability with disagreement, despite the many stable countries around the world with multiple parties in their parliaments, and a long list of very unstable countries with only one ruling party. Stability stems from a strong people, an excellent civil service and a clean justice system, and we can certainly have all of that even with opposition MPs. Maybe it is because of the dim memory of pre-1965 Singapore, or maybe we've been conditioned to have a Pavlovian reaction of fear to disagreements in parliament. But most of us believe this argument without actually having experienced any form of disagreement in our government in recent times.
 
There are more of such arguments flying around: like the natural assumption that opposition parties are "looking after themselves" but somehow the PAP isn't. I'm not saying that these arguments necessarily don't work. They might. Maybe we can't handle disagreements in parliament, and a one-party parliament is really better for all of us. My point is that we have accepted these arguments without considering otherwise: it puts up a huge unconscious barrier for any opposition party at each election, which personally I find very unfortunate.
