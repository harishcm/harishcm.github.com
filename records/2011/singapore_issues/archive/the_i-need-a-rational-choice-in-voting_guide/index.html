<pre>The "I-Need-A-Rational-Choice-In-Voting" Guide
01 மே 2011, 22:12 க்கு Michael Tjinஆல்

I've decided to write this note in response to the many anti-Opposition/anti-PAP notes that have been floating around Facebook lately. It is not that I do not appreciate such notes, but the number of notes which appeals to the voter's emotions have completely got me baffled. Such notes fail to focus on key important bread-and-butter issues that will affect our lives for the next five-years-or-so. Instead, both sides involve in an unhealthy amount of mud-slinging, dirt-digging and finger-pointing. I find it ironic and hypocritical that both camps accuse each other of slinging dirt, when they themselves involve in doing so. Sigh.
 
A little disclaimer before I begin; this note will take a rational, neutral and non-partisan viewpoint. I am not affiliated to any political party in any way. I intend to appeal to logic and sensibility rather than emotions - there are plenty of notes that does the latter, but too little that does the former. Of course, I do have my own political views, but I will not let it influence this note, making it non-partisan
 
 
1) Know Your Parties And Their Goals
 
The other day, I had dinner with an old friend and the topic of our discussion turned to politics. He, being the ardent anti-PAP supporter, was trying to convince me that voting for PAP this election would be the biggest mistake any Singaporean could make. He spent a good half-hour explaining the flaws of the PAP, but when I asked him what did the Opposition in his area propose in their manifesto, he sheepishly admitted that he hadn't a clue.
 
Despite the small geographical size of Singapore, it is astounding to note that we have more than 20 political parties in Singapore, in which 7 of them are currently politically active and vying for votes in the upcoming General Elections.
 
Many anti-PAP supporters often rally together under a "Vote For Change" or "Vote For Opposition" slogan to boot out the PAP. While they should be commended for uniting together for a common cause, many also fail to realise that the 'Opposition' is a coalition of six different political parties, with six different ideologies. Needless to say, they have released six different manifestos for the upcoming election.
 
Out of convenience, I've listed all the political parties and their manifestos:
 
National Solidarity Party (NSP)
http://www.scribd.com/doc/53562332/National-Solidarity-Party-Manifesto-2011
People's Action Party (PAP)
http://www.pap.org.sg/ge2011incl/manifesto2011eng.pdf
Reform Party (RP)
http://votingrp.wordpress.com/about/
Singapore Democratic Alliance (SDA)
http://www.sgda.org.sg/sda-manifesto-2011.html
Singapore Democratic Party (SDP)
http://ge2011.yoursdp.org/solutions
Singapore People's Party (SPP)
http://www.spp.org.sg/?p=196
Worker's Party (WP)
http://www.wp.sg/manifesto/
 
Many anti-PAP/anti-Opposition supporters will stop and question the necessity to read manifestos, claiming that the flaws of the other camp is enough evidence to reject them; I beg to differ. It's essentially critical to read the manifesto of the political parties contesting your area in order to understand the vision these parties have for Singapore and us as Singaporeans. Such visions will reveal the agenda these parties will take when elected into Parliament, allowing you to make a more informed vote.
 
By reading the manifestos, it allows you to think about whether the party views are agreeable to you. Many people have voted in the PAP election after election, only to find that they do not agree with the PAP's views. Such people were not well-informed when they made their vote, and they have only themselves to blame for not doing so.
 
There is no point electing in a party whose views you disagree with, so don't make the mistake of voting the party whose ideology you cannot accept. If you choose to do so, then you can only blame yourself when you find that the party's views run in conflict with yours. After all, you DID vote them in...
 
Secondly, the current hype of the Elections has sparked multiple discussions among friends, online, etc. If you want people to agree with your point-of-view, then you have to make sound arguments on why your view is superior, which requires research and knowledge. "Smoking" your points are fun, but brings about much embarrassment if someone is able to see through the smoke and tear your argument down.
 
Humans do not rely solely on emotions. The education system in Singapore has allowed us to be critical thinkers, able to think rationally and objectively. To convince people to your side, it is essential that you can present sound arguments that can convince.
 
Besides, with the sheer mass of anti-Opposition/anti-PAP literature attempting to "fix" each other, many Singaporeans are now left wondering what can the Opposition/PAP offer them. Name-calling, mud-slinging and dirt-digging will not convince a new generation of voters. Rather, logical arguments on what the various parties can offer Singaporeans will convince the electorate why these parties should be voted in.
 
Thirdly, many often complain about the current incumbents, often calling for more Opposition support to boot out the PAP. I shall not comment on that, but I will like to add the following:
 
There is zero point in complaining about the current "clowns" in office, only to vote in other "clowns", and thus leading another round of moaning &amp; groaning.
 
I encourage those who wish to vote for Opposition parties to read the various Opposition manifestos along with the PAP's. This is not to defray people from voting for the Opposition, but it allows you to make the informed choice. We wish to vote in wise leaders from both camps who will be able to lead Singaporeans objectively, fairly and justly. We don't wish to shoot ourselves in the foot by replacing "clowns" with more "clowns", if not Parliament will really become a circus and we'll really be in Sinkapore.
 
 
2) Read &amp; Research the Media.
 
While manifestos are important in giving an idea of what various parties' ideologies are, there is also a need to continuously research. Often, many points stated in the manifestos are expanded after they have been released through the media, giving voters a clearer view of how the parties wish to implement their ideas.
 
With the rise of the social media, many are turning to the internet as a source of information. Socio-political blogs such as The Online Citizen (TOC) and Temasek Review (TR) should be commended for continuously encouraging people to engage themselves in the socio-political issues of Singapore, an alternative to the government-controlled traditional media.
 
That's where I draw the line.
 
However, the advent of people relying solely on such socio-political blogs are alarming. They are a great source of research and literature, but it must be noted that they only give opinions about current affairs. They are not professional journalists, nor do they always have the facts and statistics. Using them as your only source of political views, as a friend of mine once said, is akin to using Wikipedia as your main source in academic essays.
 
TOC and TR may represent the views of the normal Singaporean, but at the same time, the validity of their views is also questionable. How assured are we that they are not sensationalising their stories, exaggerating them to gain sympathy? How assured are we that it is not an extremely vocal minority overcrowding the silent majority? They are not without biases; majority of their articles seem to be critical of the PAP and their policies, choosing only to nitpick on the negative aspects of it.
 
The same goes for those who solely rely on traditional media. Do you actually believe that The Straits Times and The New Paper and such are really non-partisan?
 
For the uninformed, Singapore's control of the media has often been criticised from international organisations, controlling dissemination of information to the public, repressing political opposition and suppressing independent reporting. Reporters Without Borders ranked Singapore 136 out of 178 on its Press Freedom Index. That’s extremely low.
 
Furthermore, the Newspaper and Printing Presses Act prevents independent journalism. No newspaper is allowed to be printed and published in Singapore without permission from the government, and they have authority to grant or revoke a permit, effectively allowing placing the media under the governmental control. The viewpoint of mainstream media, for the longest time, has been skewed in favour of the ruling government.
 
However, I have noticed a trend in the traditional media becoming less partisan and more objective. It is not uncommon to see Opposition candidates being featured in the newspapers for the right reasons, discussing their ideologies and plans for the future. The Forum page of The Straits Times and Today newspaper are rife with political discussions, praising and criticizing various political parties. Will this continue post GE2011? We shall see in a few months time...
 
Plus, as much as the traditionnal-media's views are skewed, they still deal with cold, hard facts. The Singapore Press Holdings is still a professional media conglomerate, dealing with solid facts &amp; stastistics. Such conglomerates have journalistic pride; to "smoke" their articles out is considered to be unethical. Despite the skewed views, we can at least aspect hard facts and stastistics that is hard to dispute.
 
And if you have doubts, there are international media conglomerates which you can cross-reference. BBC, NBC, FOX, etc.
 
For any objective person, it is important to read BOTH the ‘traditional media’ and ‘new media’. Reading both allows you to see the two sides of the coin clearly, allowing you to make more informed decisions and choices. Not all PAP say is absolute truth, but neither are all the ideas of Opposition parties. Since both camps are absolutely fantastic at nitpicking each other’s ideas, a healthy dose of objective reading would allow one to examine the strengths and weakness of various ideas and give the reader a better understanding of what he’s voting for.
 
For the record, I subscribe to both The Straits Times and The Online Citizen.
 
 
3) Attend the Rallies
 
Some people argue that rallies are mere spectacles, not reflective of the numbers in Parliament. True, if votes were decided at rallies, the PAP would be out, and the Workers Party would form the majority party.
 
People shun political rallies for various reasons. The common reason given is that what has been said at rallies will be reported in both ST and TOC, saving them the trouble to head down to rallies.
 
Yet, I find that attending rallies is just one way to judge a candidate's calibre.
 
On the rally stage, there is no turning back. A candidate may have his speech ready, may have rehearsed it a million times, but his body language has the ability to reveal what is on his mind - whether he talks with conviction or with doubt. For what reason should we vote in one whose heart is not in the right place?
 
On the rally stage, there is no turning back; a blunder made cannot be easily retracted. It is where you will see the candidates - raw and unedited. One word spoken out of line would have multiple implications and results, and you'll be able to see the true colours of that candidate. Remember PM Lee's talk about 'fixing the Opposition'? That's just one of the many blunders made, live.
 
Furthermore, what has been said in the manifestos will probably be expanded at the Rallies. As much as the manifestos try to cover all possible ground, ideas are still being refined even as the campaign continues on. What was not made extremely clear in the manifestos will be made even clearer at Rallies.
 
Some may argue that videos of the Rallies will be uploaded into Facebook. While it does save many the trouble, even that won't give you a comprehensive idea of what was said at the Rallies. Many of such videos circulating around Facebook tend to feature the heavyweights, or popular candidates. Many 'smaller' candidates are left out, along with their arguments, and many of such arguments hold as much weight as those from the popular/heavyweights.
 
If you wish to get a comprehensive view, go to the Rallies. They're free anyway.
 
 
4) Know Your Candidates
 
We know the parties contesting our areas, we know their manifestos, we know their plans should they be elected into Parliament. Then why in the world must we still know our candidates properly?
 
The simple reason is because these will be the people we will need to consult in Meet-The-MP sessions. These will be the people who will be serving us for the next four, five years. Surely you would want to vote for a candidate that shows credibility and is able to serve the people in his ward well. Should you need the help of the MP, surely you would want him to play his part, no?
 
Besides, it prevents you from making statements like:
"HOMAGAWD! TIN PEI LING IS SO CUTE, I'M VOTING PAP IN SEMBAWANG!"
 
OR
 
"HOMAGAWD! NICOLE SEAH IS SO PRETTY, NSP IS CONTESTING JURONG GRC, I'M VOTING FOR HER!"
 
For the record, both Ms Tin and Ms Seah are contesting in Marine Parade GRC. If you don't stay within that GRC, then trying to vote for the respective parties will not benefit them directly. Also, should they be elected, you can't travel down to Marine Parade to ask them to help with your problems. They will still ask you to go back and ask your MP, who would have a much clearer picture of the situation in your ward.
 
Some candidates clearly deserve to be voted into Parliament, but some candidates simply do not. No matter how good/bad the party's image may be, it cannot be denied that each party has its good men and bad apples. Regardless of party, it is important to vote in the good men, but kick out the bad apples. After all, we don't need jokers in Parliament.
 
Furthermore, its also important that you do your research on them - their qualifications, their background, what they've done, their motivations for entering politics, etc. Such research is important, because it allows you to know who you are voting for. After all, the MPs you're voting in will be serving you, and you would want a good MP to help with various problems, no?
 
 
5) Know What You Want
 
"Do You Want A Good Policy Maker, or a Good Debater for an MP?"
 
That was a question posed by a (different) friend over dinner lately. His logic was that while many Opposition candidates were good debaters, they lacked the experience of making good policies. Their ideas were good, well-articulated, well-thought, and definitely valid. However, because of their lack of experience, the feasibility of their ideas had yet to be seen, and may not even work in Singapore.
 
I did not agree with him fully, but he did bring a valid point. The ideal answer is that we want BOTH a good policy maker who can debate well in Parliament, but more often than not, we end up either having a good debater, a good policy maker, or someone who can't do both well. *cough*
 
However, while thinking about the question, it dawned on me that there was a more fundamental question behind that question, which was the question of:
 
"What exactly do YOU, as a voter want?"
 
It is easy to repeat the rhetoric that our respective political camps constantly espouse, but the question lies in whether you truly believe in what your political camp says. It is easy to merely parrot what your peers said, but do you truly believe in what you say? The former merely gives in to peer pressure and mimics the rhetoric, the latter speaks with conviction.
 
A university lecturer once commented that many talk about supporting the Opposition for a multitude of reasons, yet they still vote for PAP at the ballot box. Should what he say be true, then we've reached a very sad point in our political awareness, because it shows how convicted we are of our political beliefs. It means we are merely hollow shells, repeating what has been given to us but never truly convicted of it.
 
The same thing goes with PAP supporters. There are people who would vocally support the PAP because they see the benefits the incumbents have given, yet they confess that they have doubts in the current system because of various reasons. They feel unconvinced of what they believe in, voting for the PAP each election but doubting their own choice every time.
 
No matter whether you're pro-Opposition or pro-PAP, it will not help either camp if we remain wishy-washy about what we believe in. There is no point in talking so much about supporting our various causes, yet we switch allegiances at the ballot box. It makes us hypocritical; mere sheep following the crowd, the herd mentality.
 
So I end this note with the exact same question. What exactly do YOU want as a voter?
Decide, believe, and make your vote, for the furtherance of Singapore.
 
 
Edit:
I welcome all fruitful discussions on this note. However, any attempts to flame will be deleted.
