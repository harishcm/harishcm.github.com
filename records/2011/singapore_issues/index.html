<li class="L1">Inspiration <ol>
<p class="P2">The Singapore General Election 2011 was revolutionary to me.
It was the first time that I had voiced out and campaigned about a
multitude of issues related to Singapore in the public sphere&#8212;the
internet&#8212;without feeling a fear of prosecution or ridicule.
</p>
<p class="P2">
It&#8217;s a new social movement in Singapore, and I am extremely glad for
this new voice that I have found, and for the efforts of the many
people who have helped in bringing it about.
</p>
<p class="P2">
It now makes sense to have a separate learning project for my works
and links to resources regarding Singapore issues. </p>

<li class="L3">Perception 2011-08-13 <ol>
<p class="P4">The note talks about the central importance of &#8220;frames&#8221; in
political discourse. It seems that in order to win a political
argument, one has to learn to &#8220;frame&#8221; issues from perspectives
that suits one&#8217;s own values, or the values of the people that
one wishes to influence. </p>

<p class="P4">I found the section from 04:23 onwards enlightening as it

The presentation ends off with advice to voters who
want to see change (07:52 onwards):
</p>
<p class="P4">
&#8220;If &#8230; people &#8230; demanding change, are not prepared to
put aside 9 days to volunteer on the ground &#8230; for house
visits, distributing flyers, and assisting in organising rallies
during the campaign period, then they should not expect
change.&#8221; </p>

<li class="L3">Perspective 2012-09-24 <ol>
<p class="P4">A glimpse into parts of Singapore in the 1930s. It was
amazing&#8212;the beauty of the architecture and the developed state
of the roads and amenities. While only a small proportion of the
population was able to make full use of them, it showcases the
high degree of development that had already occurred in Singapore
during the earlier part of the 20th century. </p>
</ol>
<li class="L3">Thought 2012-09-24 <ol>
<p class="P4">I had seen this short film several months before, but kept
thinking that the film couldn&#8217;t have been made in the 1930s.
I kept thinking that the date was faked in some way. It was
only upon viewing it again, and looking at the imagery at a
deeper level, that I began to feel that it may actually be
truly filmed in the 1930s.
</p>
<p class="P4">
It is interesting that I had this mental model of a
&#8220;backward&#8221; Singapore in the 1930s. Obviously, a large part
had to do with our history textbooks in school, but
something makes me feel that this is a lot deeper than that.
It is something that is not confined to Singapore alone, but
something that can shed light upon the ways in which we
think about our forefathers, the past, and about history
itself. </p>
