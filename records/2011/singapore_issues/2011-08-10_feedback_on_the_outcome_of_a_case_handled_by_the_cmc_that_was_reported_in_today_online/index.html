<pre>Subject: Feedback on the outcome of a case handled by the CMC that was reported in TODAY Online

To: Community Mediation Unit, Ministry of Law &lt;mlaw_hq_cmc@mlaw.gov.sg&gt; 

Dear Sir/Madam,

I read with surprise the outcome of a case handled by Community Mediation Centre mediator, Madam Marcellina Giam, which was published in TODAY Online &lt;http://www.todayonline.com/Singapore/EDC110808-0000102/Number-of-neighbour-disputes-hit-high&gt;.

The case was between a "family, who had just moved here from China" and their "Singapore Indian neighbours" over the issue of "the smell of curry".

Here is the section of the article that mentions the case:

--- 
Case 1: A family, who had just moved here from China, had resorted to mediation because they could not stand the smell of curry that their Singaporean Indian neighbours would often cook. The Indian family, who were mindful of their neighbour's aversion, had already taken to closing their doors and windows whenever they cooked the dish, but this was not enough.

"They said: 'Can you please do something? Can you don't cook curry? Can you don't eat curry?'," said Madam Marcellina Giam, a Community Mediation Centre mediator. But the Indian family stood firm. In the end, Mdm Giam got the Indian family to agree to cook curry only when the Chinese family was not home. In return, they wanted their Chinese neighbours to at least give their dish a try. 
---

As a Singaporean, I recall with pride that we as a people, are tolerant and understanding of the myriad of cultures and cultural practices found in Singapore. In many instances, we go further, and actively celebrate our myriad of cultures. Food, is a prime aspect of this celebration of cultures, and is one of the distinctive features of what makes Singapore, unique.

From a global perspective, this Singaporean culture of tolerance and understanding, and celebration of cultural diversity, is one of the main reasons that foreigners from the world over find Singapore a safe, yet exciting and vibrant place. These desirable factors are in turn among the main reasons why many choose to live, work and play in Singapore.

Against this backdrop, the outcome of the mediation appears extremely unrepresentative of the norms and cultural sensitivities that pervade this nation---ones that have worked extremely well for us all these years.

Turning to possible effects of the settlement, it is deeply unsettling that the CMC settlement could be binding. A binding settlement would mean that if the Singapore Indian family fails to adhere to the settlement, the family from China can sue them in court for damages. The CMC website explains how a settlement could be made binding under contract law &lt;http://app2.mlaw.gov.sg/MediationServices/MediationProcedure/Overview/tabid/305/Default.aspx&gt;:

--- 
Any settlement arrived at will be binding on the parties if it is written down, signed by all parties, and the document itself contains a statement specifying its binding nature. If the disputants have signed such an agreement, any breach of its terms by one party would be grounds for the other to institute legal proceedings for breach of contract. 
---

Given the wide publicity that the case now enjoys, another possible effect is that the case may become a de-facto precedent for future CMC mediation cases involving similar disputes. Such a situation, something previously unthinkable, would be devastating to our Singaporean culture of tolerance and understanding, and celebration of cultural diversity.

As a personal observation, the Singaporean Indian family seems to have been nice, by being "mindful of their neighbour's aversion", and by "closing their doors and windows whenever they cooked the dish", out of goodwill. Ironically, the tone in which the family from China asked their questions, "'Can you please do something? Can you don't cook curry? Can you don't eat curry?'," seems to reek of condescension and ignorance of local cultures, with perhaps a tinge of intolerance. If this were indeed the case, the settlement was clearly unfair.

We welcome foreigners who can contribute to Singapore with open arms. In the same vein, foreigners who come to Singapore have to integrate with the Singaporean culture quickly.

Things are well within the CMC's control. Given the wide publicity attracted by this case, and its great importance, I hope the CMC would publish further details and clarifications of the case in the local media, such as whether the settlement was binding. I also hope that the CMC would assist both families in coming to a new settlement that both reflects the norms and cultural sensitivities of Singapore, and sets a fair precedent that assists both local and foreigner neighbours in better integrating with one another.

Thank you.

Best Regards, 
Harish
