<h2 id="what_is_self_directed_learning"><a name="index1h2"></a>What is self-directed learning?</h2>

<p>Self-directed learning is a natural process, one that everyone indulges in.
It begins the moment one gets excited about a certain
question, idea, activity, interest or perspective.
I term these <a href="../framework/ad-hoc_interests/">ad-hoc interests</a>.</p>

<p>Self-directed learning then develops as one engages in learning pursuits.
Here one seeks guidance from various sources, decides upon one&#8217;s methods
of learning, and validates one&#8217;s progress from time to time.</p>

<p>Self-directed learning never really ends. 
One learning pursuit almost always leads to several others. 
Previous learning pursuits are often revisited, especially after gaining new 
insights, perspectives, skills or information.
Also, new ad-hoc interests may be just around the corner,
kick-starting self-directed learning yet again.</p>

<h2 id="is_self_directed_learning_practical_or_is_it_just_hot_air"><a name="index2h2"></a>Is self-directed learning practical? Or is it just hot air?</h2>

<p>Self-directed learning is practical. 
But, it requires a certain amount of awareness and management to be effective.</p>

<p>First, self-directed learning will occur naturally when one experiences
periods of sufficient time in a fairly stimulating environment, and 
is given the space and freedom to express oneself.</p>

<p>Most people do experience such periods at least occasionally&#8212;for example, 
in certain lessons at school, some forms of work, 
vacations, breaks, etc..
We can create more such periods fairly easily as well, eg., time spent channel 
surfing, while travelling and when taking a break.</p>

<p>An awareness however, has to be developed that these periods follow the clock 
blindly. 
They do not follow the development of our creations or learning pursuits.
So, while we may earnestly begin to express our creativity or embark on 
learning pursuits, it is likely that they will come crashing down when the 
period ends. That is, if nothing else is done.</p>

<p>Coming from such a viewpoint, a few practical measures are necessary for 
effective self-directed learning:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Being able to resume our learning pursuits from where we left off.</p></li>
<li><p>Being opportunistic about selecting conducive periods for
self-directed learning.</p></li>
<li><p>Being able to learn from as many sources and situations as possible.</p></li>
<li><p>Specifically making time for our learning pursuits and interests when
necessary.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The <a href="../framework/">framework</a> provides a perspective on incorporating the above into one&#8217;s
daily life.</p>

<h2 id="but_how_does_one_learn_on_one______s_own"><a name="index3h2"></a>But how does one learn on one’s own?</h2>

<p>Learning on one&#8217;s own is not as difficult as is commonly thought.
If you have ever done research on any topic, you already
know how to start. 
What you may need to work on is <a href="../framework/improving_learning_itself/">improving learning itself</a>.</p>

<p>It is only when you intend to achieve mastery in a certain fields
that you should be concerned&#8212;it is likely to take a 
<em>much, much longer time</em> than you would initially expect.</p>

<p><a href="../framework/learning_projects/">Organising your learning pursuits</a> and 
<a href="../framework/record_keeping/">keeping records</a> will greatly help as well.</p>

<p><a href="./#index1h1">^</a></p>

<h2 id="what_if_i_am_lazy"><a name="index4h2"></a>What if I am lazy?</h2>

<p>Aren&#8217;t we all? 
Only that next time you feel lazy: chill, relax and continue being lazy. 
Yes, really. And don&#8217;t feel guilty about it. 
And make sure that you are lazy continuously.</p>

<p>For how long would you be able to sit still? For how long
could you continuously be lazy?
A day? A week? A month? A year? Try it!</p>

<p>It is natural for us to learn things on our own.</p>
