<div class="img"><img src="./framework_components.png" width="197" height="156" class="img" /><div class="caption">A framework for self-directed learning: ad-hoc interests; learning projects; 
                record keeping; and improving learning itself.   
                While self-directed learning is fluid and often unpredictable, a framework aids in rationalizing
                and in communication with others.</div></div>

<p>Self-directed learning can quickly take a life of its own.
As you uncover previously unknown unknowns, 
self-directed learning will take you to places you 
never knew or thought possible.</p>

<p>This is a key strength of self-directed learning,
but it can also impede its rationalization and communication.</p>

<p>Here I present a framework that I have found useful
for rationalizing self-directed learning and discussing it with others.</p>

<h2 id="components">Components</h2>

<h3><a href="./ad-hoc_interests/">Ad-hoc Interests</a></h3>

<p>Ad-hoc interests are the sparks and fuel for self-directed learning.
They get you excited about wanting to learn more, and keep you on track
in doing so. </p>

<p>Intriguing questions, creative ideas, random thoughts, interesting 
perspectives and empowering resources&#8212;these are all part of your 
ad-hoc interests.</p>

<h3>Flexible <a href="./learning_projects/">Learning Projects</a></h3>

<p>As you pursue an increasing number of ad-hoc interests, 
organizing them and having a sense of direction becomes important.
Guiding yourself through learning projects offers a flexible means of 
accomplish both the above.</p>

<h3>Clean and Lean <a href="./record_keeping/">Record Keeping</a></h3>

<p>Learning occurs in leaps and bounds, and record keeping is
crucial in allowing you to pick up from where you left off.
As time goes on, record keeping becomes more and more important.
Record keeping also facilitates reflection and forms a basis for
credibility. Unfortunately, record keeping also comes with its own challenges
that the self-directed learner has to overcome.</p>

<h3><a href="./improving_learning_itself/">Improving Learning Itself</a></h3>

<p>The self-directed nature of self-directed learning, in itself, 
warrants special attention towards improving your learning.
Moreover, this is where self-directed learning shines exceptionally.</p>

<h2 id="inspiration_for_the_framework">Inspiration for the Framework</h2>

<p>When I first contemplated about taking a year off university to focus on
self-directed learning, I was faced with communication issues:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How would I explain my plan to my professors and the administration? 
  How would I explain to them that I was going to be free to pursue whatever
  I wanted, whenever and however I wanted? 
  These ideas were new to them, even &#8220;unheard of&#8221;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To put things into perspective for the university,
there was this push within myself to develop a framework:
something that would make self-directed learning seem more conceptualized;
something that would make it readily acceptable&#8230;</p>
