<h1 id="learning_projects">Learning Projects </h1>




<p>Learning projects can be seen as analogous to modules within
a formal education course. They serve as a means of consolidation and
organisation.
However, unlike modules, learning projects are meant to be flexible
in methodology and unrestricted in scope.</p>

<p>Learning projects also need to cater for divergence from initial learning goals.
Divergence refers to the tendency to get interested in
several other things while pursuing a single learning interest.
Divergence is bound to occur, and is part and parcel of the
discovery process.</p>

<p>The following sections discuss <em>lifecycles of learning projects</em> and <em>managing divergence</em>
in greater detail.</p>

<h2 id="lifecycles_of_learning_projects">Lifecycles of Learning Projects</h2>

<p>Learning projects begin naturally from one or more <a href="../ad-hoc_interests/">ad-hoc interests</a>.
For instance, there could be a certain synergy or commonality between two or more
ad-hoc interests.
One may then wish to investigate and build upon them.
At other times, you may have developed specific aims and goals regarding one of
your ad-hoc interests, and wish to pursue them with greater vigor.</p>

<p>Learning projects then proceed with you locating and exploring
relevant resources.
One has the freedom to use resources and a learning methodology that suits you best.
Special emphasis is placed upon <a href="../record_keeping/">keeping records</a> of the investigative process and relevant resources.</p>

<div class="img"><img src="../lifecycle_1.png" width="193" height="260" class="img" /><div class="caption">Typical lifecycle of learning projects: Learning projects typically start off as ad-hoc interests. As they develop, they may be split into two or more branches. Learning projects may either be left open ended or be ended with a conclusion.</div></div>


<p>Learning projects are generally not bounded in breadth or depth.
Often however, you will realise that a different direction
from that being pursued, is necessary.
This is likely to happen after you stumble upon
<a href="../improving_learning_itself/#unknown_unknowns"><em>unknown unknowns</em></a> and uncovers them.
This is also likely to happen when you find that prerequisite knowledge is
necessary for effectively continuing with the current learning project.
Sometimes, you may also find a learning project to have become too complex
or too diverse to manage as a single entity.</p>

<p>At such junctures, the current learning project may be split into two or
more branches. Alternatively, situations may arise when two or more
learning projects are merged together.</p>

<div class="img"><img src="../lifecycle_2.png" width="234" height="188" class="img" /><div class="caption">Alternate lifecycle of learning projects: Two or more ad-hoc interests or learning projects that exhibit synergy may be combined into a single learning project.</div></div>


<p>Dormant learning projects are usually left open for input indefinitely.
Partially, this is to symbolize that learning never ends.
More importantly however, it is natural for learning to occur in leaps and bounds.
Learning projects are left open ended so that you can go back to dormant learning projects
months or years later.
Well-kept records of the investigative process facilitate going back to dormant learning projects.</p>

<h2 id="managing_divergence">Managing Divergence</h2>

<p>Divergence refers to the tendency to get interested in
several other things while pursuing a single learning interest.
If not managed properly, you can be left with the feeling that
you have not pursued anything to completion.</p>

<p>Divergence is a common experience and is part and parcel of the process
of the discovery process.
As you start learning about something, you become aware that there are
so many other things that you never knew existed.
These make you better informed. Yet at the same time,
they may be more interesting or more important to you.
They may be prerequisites for your current learning project
or may add value to it.
Thus, for very good reasons, you will often get tempted to diverge from your
current pursuits.</p>

<p>Two of ways of managing divergence are discussed below.</p>

<h3 id="setting_moving_targets_instead_of_stationary_ones">Setting moving targets instead of stationary ones</h3>

<p>Setting moving targets instead of stationary ones allows you to adapt a
flexible mindset&#8212;one that accepts that divergence is both probable and welcomed.
With this flexible mindset, you will be able to deal with divergence better.
In addition, negative feelings associated with divergence can be relaxed and let go.</p>

<h3 id="branching_off_new_ad_hoc_interests_and_learning_projects">Branching off new ad-hoc interests and learning projects</h3>

<p>With learning projects, you are free to branch off new ad-hoc interests
and learning projects from those currently pursued.
Then, you either</p>

<ul>
<li>archive records and creations from your current
pursuit and start the new one, or</li>
<li>take record your new interest and continue with your current pursuit.</li>
</ul>


<p>Either way, you are fully aware that you can still go back to either
one in the future. You can thus continue with a peace of mind.</p>
