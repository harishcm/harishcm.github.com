<h1 id="learning_projects">Learning Projects</h1>

<p>Learning projects can be seen as analogous to modules within
a formal education course. They serve as a means of consolidation and 
organisation.
However, unlike modules, learning projects are meant to be flexible
in methodology and unrestricted in scope.</p>

<p>Learning projects also need to cater for divergence from initial learning goals.
Divergence is bound to occur, and is part of parcel of the 
discovery process. </p>

<h2 id="lifecycles_of_learning_projects">Lifecycles of Learning Projects</h2>

<div class="img"><img src="../lifecycle_1.png" width="193" height="260" class="img" /><div class="caption">Typical lifecycle of learning projects: Learning projects start off from
                ad-hoc interests. As they develop, they could be split into two or more branches.
                Learning projects could be left open ended or could end with a conclusion.</div></div>

<div class="img"><img src="../lifecycle_2.png" width="234" height="188" class="img" /><div class="caption">Alternate lifecycle of learning projects: Two or more ad-hoc interests
                that exhibit synergy could be combined into a single learning project.
                Two learning projects that have converged over time could be merged into a
                single learning project.</div></div>

<p>Learning projects begin naturally from one or more <a href="../ad-hoc_interests/">ad-hoc interests</a>.
For instance, there could be a certain synergy or commonality between two or more
of your ad-hoc interests that you wish to investigate and build upon.
At other times, you may have developed specific aims and goals regarding one of 
your ad-hoc interests, and wish to pursue them with greater vigor.</p>

<p>Learning projects then proceed with the self-directed learner locating and exploring
relevant resources.
He/she has to freedom to use resources and a learning methodology that suits him/her best.
Special emphasis is placed upon documenting the investigative process behind uncovering 
information and relevant resources.
<a href="../record_keeping/">Record keeping</a> is considered vital.</p>

<p>Learning projects are generally not bounded in breadth or depth.
Often however, the self-directed learner will realise that a different direction 
from the one currently pursued, is necessary.
This is likely to happen after one stumbles upon one or more
<a href="../improving_learning_itself/#unknown_unknowns"><em>unknown unknowns</em></a>.
This is also likely to happen when one finds that prerequisite knowledge is
necessary for effectively continuing with the current learning project.
Sometimes, he/she may also find a learning project to have become to complex
or diverse to manage.</p>

<p>At such conjunctures, the current learning project may be split into two or
more branches. Alternatively, situations may arise when two or more 
learning projects are merged together.</p>

<p>Dormant learning projects are usually left open for input indefinitely.
Partially, this is to symbolize that learning never ends.
More importantly however, it is natural for learning to occur in leaps and bounds.
Thus, it is common for one to go back to dormant learning projects
months or years later.
Well-kept records of the investigative process facilitate such situations.</p>

<h2 id="managing_divergence">Managing Divergence</h2>

<p>Divergence refers to the tendency to get interested in
several other things while pursuing a single learning interest.
If not managed properly, one can be left with the feeling that
one has not pursued anything to completion.</p>

<p>Divergence is a common experience and is part and parcel of the process
of the discovery process.
As you start learning about something, you become aware that there are 
so many other things that you never knew existed.
These make you better informed. Yet at the same time
they may be more interesting or more important to you.
They may be prerequisites for your current learning project
or may value add to it.
Thus, for very good reasons, you will often get tempted to diverge from your
current pursuits.</p>

<p>Two of ways of managing divergence are discussed below.</p>

<h3 id="setting_moving_targets_instead_of_stationary_ones">Setting moving targets instead of stationary ones</h3>

<p>Setting moving targets instead of stationary ones provides you with an mindset 
that accepts that divergence is probably and welcomed. 
Firstly, such a positive mindset allows you to deal with divergence better.
Secondly, it relaxes negative feelings associated with not able to see a 
particular, fixed, pursuit through to completion.</p>

<h3 id="branching_off_new_ad_hoc_interests_and_learning_projects">Branching off new ad-hoc interests and learning projects</h3>

<p>With learning projects, you are free to branch off new ad-hoc interests
and learning projects from those currently pursued.
Then, you either archive records and creations from your current
pursuit and start the new one, or you take record your new interest
and continue with your current pursuit.
Either way, you are fully aware that you can still go back to either 
one in the future, and can thus continue with a peace of mind.</p>
