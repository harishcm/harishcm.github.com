<h1 id="improving_learning_itself">Improving Learning Itself</h1>

<h2 id="rationale">Rationale</h2>

<p>The self-directed nature of self-directed learning is reason enough
for special attention to be paid towards improving one&#8217;s learning.
Improving one&#8217;s learning is also an extremely rewarding pursuit,
both intrinsically and extrinsically.</p>

<p>The first steps are usually to overcome <a href="../../faqs/">doubts and misinformation</a>
and about self-directed learning.
Beyond that, one tries to put into practice other learning improvements
that one comes across.
The possibilities are unlimited, but here are some of my explorations.</p>



<h2 id="sense_of_purpose">Sense of purpose</h2>

<p>Learning and creative work go hand in hand with context and a sense of purpose.
I have found the following to give me a sense purpose for self-directed 
learning:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Making the knowledge I gain directly useful in my daily life.</p></li>
<li><p>Identifying links between different fields, and using knowledge and skills
from one field to enhance knowledge and skills in another.</p></li>
<li><p>Being able to utilize multiple learning resources, and reducing dependence
on any one of them.</p></li>
<li><p>Regaining a sense of dignity and self-trust in my abilities
to come up with my own creations that were of value.</p></li>
<li><p>Being able to continuously build on my discoveries and creations;
not trashing them after they were graded.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="gaining_new_perspectives">Gaining new perspectives</h2>

<h3 id="we_are_biased_in_absorbing_and_assimilating_information">We are biased in absorbing and assimilating information</h3>

<p>It is a natural tendency for us to preferentially absorb only what we want to
hear. We also tend to preferentially assimilate only what fits in with our 
current world view. The self-directed learner is not immune to this. </p>

<p>Sometimes it is a good thing: such as when we wish to gain trust in our 
abilities, or when we realise that views initially suppressed were held by
others as well. However, it can lead to stagnation and inertia in learning,
and in extreme cases make us blind to the truth around us.</p>

<h3 id="unknown_unknowns">Unknown Unknowns</h3>

<p><em>Unknown unknowns</em> are everything that one has never come across 
or thought of before. Unknown unknowns are distinct from <em>known unknowns</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Let&#8217;s say that you are trying very hard to prepare for a spelling test by 
  next week.
  Though you still don&#8217;t know many of the words in the word list,
  you can still possibly solve your problem.
  The words in the word list you don&#8217;t know how to spell are <em>known 
  unknowns</em>.</p>
  
  <p>But let&#8217;s say that because you skipped class, you don&#8217;t know that the 
  teacher brought the test forward to this week. Then, unless you get lucky 
  and hear about the change, there is nothing you can do to solve your new 
  problem. It is an <em>unknown unknown</em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One can reasonably guess that vast majority of things around us are unknown unknowns.
However, due to their nature, we can never quantify how many of them are out there.</p>

<p>Perhaps what we can do is to be humble and try to put ourselves in situations
where we are more likely to uncover them. 
A technique I have found useful is to browse the 
book shelves in libraries, one by one, and explore titles that catch my attention.</p>

<h2 id="building_habits">Building habits</h2>

<p>Habits are determine our achievements to a large extent.
Habits usually determine what we spend a large majority of our time on.
They also determine what we do on a consistent basis.
It is just so much easier and to do something frequently
and continuously if it is a habit than if it is not.</p>

<p>By converting important activities into habits, and
breaking by breaking unproductive habits, we greatly improve our
our learning.
We also make time for what is important and are better able to fulfil our
biological and health requirements such as sleep.</p>

<h3 id="assimilating_self_directed_learning_into_daily_life">Assimilating self-directed learning into daily life</h3>

<p>If the activities of self-directed learning become your daily habits,
you would not need to put in much effort in learning on your own.
You would already do them anyway.</p>

<p>Some general examples are keeping records, visiting the library on your way back home, 
and carrying writing materials everywhere you go.
As you get more experienced, you could form other more personalized habits,
such as archiving your records, carrying around a camera, striking conversations
with random people, etc..</p>

<h3 id="sleep">Sleep</h3>

<p>Sufficient sleep is a health necessity. It also allows one to think clearly,
spontaneously generate ideas, and be more observant and perceptive of one&#8217;s surroundings.
Part of improving one&#8217;s learning is to get sufficient sleep, at regular times
of the day. Unfortunately, we forget about it&#8217;s importance, relegating it to </p>

<p>My personal experience has been that sleep has to be explicitly factored into the day&#8217;s
plan. To get to bed by a certain time, I also need a buffer period of about an hour to
finish what I was previously working on.</p>

<p>It also takes considerable discipline to tell myself to put a hold on what I am doing
and go to sleep instead. I am usually much more productive when I continue on my work
in the morning than if I push myself past my bedtime.</p>

<h3 id="making_time">Making time</h3>

<p>Making time involves three things. </p>

<p>One, is to determine what is really 
important to you or what you really wish to do over a certain time period.</p>

<p>Two, is to plan these activities, blocking out times periods for biological
activities such as sleep and meal times. It is best to include a buffer period of time
between activities to have freedom in dragging them a bit longer if need be. </p>

<p>Three is to say no the activities and people that you could
not accommodate into your schedule, without feeling guilty about it.</p>

<p>As a enhancement, you could, four, record the other things that you wanted
to do by could not fit into your schedule. That will soothe your nerves
that you will attend to them at a later time if you so wish to.
This is also one of the methods for
