<h1 id="record_keeping">Record Keeping</h1>

<p>If there was a single activity representative of self-directed learning,
it would be record keeping.
Record keeping offers a great number of benefits:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It greatly extends one&#8217;s memory; it facilitates reflection;
  it enables keeping track of progress;
  it allows one to pick up from where one last left off; and
  it even forms the basis for credibility.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unfortunately, record keeping comes with a hefty price tag.
It is expensive in time and effort. 
Furthermore, as your records pile up, managing them becomes a big issue.</p>

<p>This section discusses the above issues in greater detail.</p>

<h2 id="picking_up_from_where_you_last_left_off">Picking up from where you last left off</h2>

<p>In many of your self-directed learning pursuits, you are likely to
experience bursts of activity, followed by lengthy periods of dormancy.
This is not a sign of weakness but a natural human tendency.</p>

<p>Record keeping allows you to effectively resume your learning 
pursuits from where you last left off.
It feels truly amazing when you are able to pick up and continue on 
pursuits that you set aside several months ago.</p>

<h2 id="forming_the_basis_for_credibility">Forming the basis for credibility</h2>

<p>As you build up your records you portray a sense of credibility, both to
others and to yourself. 
For others, your records and creations are tangible entities which 
they can evaluate and form judgements about.
For yourself, looking back at your records is a 
great way to overcome the occasional feelings of doubt you will face along 
the way. </p>

<h2 id="record_keeping______s_challenges">Record keeping&#8217;s challenges</h2>

<p>Unfortunately record keeping can get expensive in terms of time and effort.
It is probably wise to keep your records format as simple as possible 
while including all that you feel is important. 
Don&#8217;t get surprised if you find yourself changing your record 
formats significantly from time to time.</p>

<p>As the amount of records increases, you will have to start managing them.
While this involves some extra work, it can also get very interesting as 
you get to play around with your creations from a more macro level. </p>
